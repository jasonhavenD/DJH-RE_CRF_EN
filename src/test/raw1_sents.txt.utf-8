docno: 1111Transition services now mandatory for soldiersBy Jim Tice - Staff writerPosted : Tuesday Apr 3, 2012 16:44:56 EDTFORT KNOX, Ky. - Soldiers now must participate in transition_services_@PROG before they leave active duty.An execution order requiring them to make use of the services is in force throughout the Army.The order applies to all soldiers who are leaving active duty, whether they are Regular_Army_members_@P3 who are separating or retiring or reservists demobilizing after six months or more on active duty.The order, which implements a directive issued last year by Army_Secretary_John_McHugh_@P1, further requires that transition processing begin at least 12 months before a soldier leaves active duty and that the soldier's commander oversee the process.The new procedures will be bolstered later this year when the Veterans_Opportunity_to_Work_Act_@DOC is implemented Nov. 20 for all the military services.
"From the Army standpoint, we are planning for that mandate, and getting additional resources to support implementation across the active and reserve components," said Walter_M._Herd_@P1, director_@REL of the Army Career and Alumni Program.This will result in about a 300 percent increase in the number of soldiers participating in transition_services_@PROG, Herd said.ACAP_@PROG, a longtime_Army_program_@PROG, assists_@REL departing_soldiers_@P3, family members and Army_career_civilians_@P3 in preparing for civilian life through myriad counseling, education, job-preparation and job-search services at 54 centers in the U.S. and overseas.The centers are staffed by counselors who have_@REL graduate degrees in counseling and who can link_up_@REL departing_soldiers_@P3 with training_and_services_offered_by_@REL the Army and other government agencies, such as the Labor and Veterans_Affairs_@ORG departments.ACAP_@PROG also operates_a_new_@REL 24-hour,_seven-day-a-week_call_center_@ORG here, and an interactive_website_@ORG for the virtual delivery of information and services, to include counseling.Regular_Army_soldiers_@P3 leaving active duty should begin their transition 24 months in advance of retirement and 18 to 12 months in advance of separation, Herd said.
"Ideally, the soldier should go to an ACAP_@PROG center, receive_@REL a pre-separation briefing and begin_to_map_out_@REL his or her transition_plan_@DOC," he said.
"This will be an individual plan to lay out how the person will transition from being a soldier to being a civilian.
"The plan will include what classes the soldier will attend, and specifically what preparations should be made, whether he is leaving service for college or to enter the civilian work force.ACAP_@PROG works_closely_with_@REL the Army Continuing Education System and can_coordinate_services_for_@REL departing_soldiers_@P3 who plan to attend college or who require professional accreditation.For example, if a soldier wants to become a plumber after leaving the Army, ACAP_@PROG and ACES counselors can assist the soldier in becoming professionally accredited.Herd said reservists normally are mobilized for a year, so they need to begin their transition processing immediately upon coming on active duty.
"For most of the Reserve_soldiers_@P3 who are going back to the same job they left, the transition will be simpler than for those who don't have an existing job," Herd said.Commanders' roleA second major goal of the execution order requires commanders to be responsible for ensuring that their soldiers are successfully transitioned.
"This is really a big change, as in the past, transition processing really was a staff issue, rather than a commander responsibility," Herd said.The new system is designed so that commanders will be notified when their soldiers begin transitioning processing.
"The commander can delegate the monitoring of a soldier's transition to subordinate officers and [noncommissioned officers], but he is responsible for making sure that the soldiers start the process at least 12 months out," Herd said.Officials expect that first sergeants and squad leaders will be major players in this process.The commander will then get periodic reports showing how many transitioning soldiers in the company, battalion or brigade have_completed_@REL pre-separation counseling, prepared a r锟斤拷sum锟斤拷, attended briefings and other ACAP_@PROG activities.
"The long-term plan is to monitor_a_soldier's_transition_processing_through_@REL Army Career_Tracker_@PROG, a_system_for_@REL enlisted soldiers, officers and Army civilians to plot their career milestones.
"We aren't quite there yet, but we will get plugged into Career_Tracker_@PROG" Herd said.Herd, a retired_colonel_@P2 and former_brigade_commander_@P2, acknowledged that with the ongoing force_alignment_and_drawdown_programs_@PROG, such as the Qualitative_Service_Program_@PROG boards, some soldiers will be required to leave active duty early, and will not have a full year for transitioning processing.
"Under those conditions, we will start a soldier's transitioning processing as soon as possible," he said.docno: 111982 Missile_ThreatA_Project_@PROG of the George C.

30, 2012 - British_military_historian_John_Keegan_@P1 once said, "It's a necessary quality of a diplomat or a politician that he will compromise.
Uncompromising politicians or diplomats get you into the most terrible trouble.
"That may never have been truer than it is today, as Congress_@ORG struggles to come up with a deal to avoid sending our country over the fiscal cliff at year's end.It would be nice if Congress_@ORG and the president would be inspired to take defense of the homeland more seriously.Perhaps most concerning are the draconian defense "sequestration" cuts that are set to take effect January 2, 2013.
The $500 billion reduction in military spending triggered by 2011's Budget_Control_Act_@DOC would be added to the $487 billion the Obama_administration_@ORG already eliminated in this year's budget request.For months, lawmakers have been warned of the potential economic impact of these indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts.
A joint study between Dr._Stephen_S._Fuller_of_George_Mason_University_@P1 and Chmura_Economics_and_Analytics_@ORG showed that America could lose an estimated 2.14 million jobs if Congress_@ORG does nothing to prevent the automatic sequestration cuts.But the effects of sequestration - on top of already reduced military spending on the president's watch - extend well-beyond our fragile economy.
Military brass and defense experts agree that such haphazard cuts would gut critical defense programs that protect this nation and our troops from harm.Secretary_of_Defense_Leon_Panetta_@P1 has said that "if additional efforts are made to go after the defense budget, I think it could have a serious impact in terms of our ability to implement" the Pentagon's stated defense strategy.
This is especially true in light of significant cuts already imposed.
As these cuts are beyond flesh and into the bone.
Further cuts now are threatening to become reckless endangerment of the American people.One urgent area of concern is missile defense, particularly_in_light_of_@REL North Korea's successful long-range_rocket_test_@PROG earlier this month.
While the White_House_@ORG deemed the launch a "highly provocative act," it was a stark reminder of the importance of investing in defensive systems that can both deter attacks and protect us increasing threats from rogue nations.Time and again our "Cold War" focused defense, diplomatic and intelligence apparatus and intelligentsia have been "surprised" by global events empowered by new social media.
Witness Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Syria, Libya and tumult in Mali.
One of the U.S. top defense and intelligence priorities is to prevent strategic surprise.
And yet the collective political group think is to apparently allow these multiple layered cuts to happen.
It is unconscionable.An immediate problem is that our current_missile_defense_budget_@DOC is woefully inadequate.
In total, the president lopped $3.6 billion off the projected budget for the Missile_Defense_Agency_@ORG (MDA_@ORG) over the next 4 years.
This is in addition to the $1.4 billion reduction for MDA_@ORG from 2009 to 2013.
"I'm disappointed, very much, in the reductions to the missile defense budget over the last four years, much of which has come at the expense of our homeland defense as well as the development of next-generation_missile_defense_systems_@WEA," retiring_Sen._Jon_Kyl_@P1, a noted defense hawk, told_a_recent_forum_sponsored_by_@REL the American_Foreign_Policy_Council.For_@ORG example, the president's 2013 budget slashed the number of Ground-Based_Interceptors_(GBIs)_@WEA - our_first_line_of_defense_against_@REL a long-range_missile_@WEA attack from North Korea - from 44 interceptors to 30.
A third GBI site along the East Coast continues_to_be_a_hot_topic_on_@REL Capitol_Hill_@ORG, but the potential for funding such a program appears dim considering we aren't properly supporting the sites we already have in Alaska and California.
As Sen._Kyl_@P1 aptly noted in his comments to AFP_@ORGC , funding for GBIs has decreased from $2.5 billion annually under President_Bush_@P1 to only $1 billion under the Obama_administration_@ORG.The next-generation_Standard_Missile-3_(SM-3)_@WEA has also been a target of significant cuts, this despite two high-profile, successful tests of the interceptor this spring and summer.Currently, the U.S. and Japanese navies are employing more than 130 first-generation_SM-3s_@WEA, but the upgraded_missile_@WEA, which is set to roll off production lines in 2015, offers enhanced capabilities to protect America and its allies.MDA_@ORG's original plan was to buy 62 SM-3 "I-Bs" but in his 2013 budget President_Obama_@P1 cut that number to a meager 29 and sliced the I-B_budget_@DOC in half.
The timing could not be worse considering that commanders in the field are saying that our current inventories of SM-3s_aboard_Aegis_ships_@WEA are already insufficient.
A recent classified STRATCOM exercise, reported by InsideDefense.com, confirmed_the_assertion_of_@REL a ballistic_missile_@WEA shortfall.Most significantly, these cuts to GBIs and SM-3s do not take into account the prospect of sequestration.
In a letter to Congress_@ORG last month, Panetta warned that sequestration would result in an additional "23 percent cut in weapons_program_@PROG would drive up unit costs and lead to reductions in quantity of one third or more.
"While both Democrats and Republicans can agree that current budget deficits are unsustainable, shrinking the U.S._missile_defense_budget_@DOC at a time when threats are exponentially increasing could prove pennywise but pound foolish.
After all, North Korea is far from the only hostile nation on our radar.
Iran and Syria remain aggressive, and the threat of Syria's weapons falling into the hands of jihadi-minded_militias_@ORG poses a very real threat to global security.Avoiding such a fate will take real compromise from Congress_@ORG and the president over the next few days.
Without a deal to avoid even more severe cuts to defense, the American people may well be in "the most terrible trouble.
"One thing that should be clear to the collective intelligentsia and politicians, strategic surprise will happen.
The American people and our allies just don't deserve to have a North Korean or Iranian missile land on our heads because we failed to properly fund missile defense.Randy Duncan is a retired Navy_@ORG captain who served_at_@REL the Defense_Missile_and_Space_Intelligence_Center_@ORG and the Defense Intelligence Agency.This entry was posted in Publications and tagged Ground-Based_Interceptor_(GBI)_@WEA , Iran , Jon Kyl , Leon Panetta , North Korea , Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) , Syria , Budget , Missile_Defense_Agency_@ORG by editor .

Making Sense of Ballistic_Missile_Defense_@PROG: An Assessment_of_Concepts_and_Systems_@TECH for U.S._Boost-Phase_Missile_Defense_@PROG in Comparison to Other Alternatives suggests that great care should be taken by the U.S. in ensuring that negotiations on space_agreements_@DOC not adversely impact missile defense effectiveness.

6, 2013 - Amid reports that China is gearing up to conduct one more anti-satellite_weapon_@WEAs test (ASAT) putting US Global_Positioning_System_(GPS)_@TECH at risk, Chinese_state_media_@ORG today asserted that Beijing had the right to carry out the test as it is a "trump card" against Washington.China may be gearing up to perform a controversial ASAT_test_@PROG this month, perhaps in the next week or two, US_media_report_@DOC said.
"In 2007 and 2010, China conducted anti-satellite_(ASAT)_weapons_tests_@PROG, both on January 11.
Rumours circulating for the past few months suggest that some within the US_defence_and_intelligence_community_@ORG believe China is preparing to conduct another ASAT_test_@PROG," Union_of_Concerned_Scientists_@ORG, a Cambridge-based body of scientists reported.China's previous tests caused concern in India too with assertions by the Indian defence officials that New Delhi also should acquire such a capability.
"Just before Christmas, a high-ranking US defence official told us that the Obama_administration_@ORG was_very_concerned_about_@REL an imminent Chinese ASAT_test_@PROG," Gregory_Kulacki_@P1, China_project_manager_@P2 of the group and senior_analyst_@P2 reported two days ago.
"Given these high-level administration concerns, and past Chinese practice, there seems to be a strong possibility China will conduct an ASAT_test_@PROG within the next few weeks.
What kind of test and what the target might be is unclear," Kulacki wrote in his report.Reacting to the report, an editorial in China's_state-run_Global_Times_@ORG said today that concerns that the test will put the US_strategic_satellites_@WEA at risk is "over blown".
"China reportedly conducted an anti-satellite_test_@PROG in early 2007, which caused a great uproar.
Some analysts said that even if China really once again launches a test, it will not strike down satellites, but invalidate them," it said without stating whether the test would be conducted.
"Whether China will launch new anti-satellite_test_@PROG is still unknown.
However China should continue substantive research on striking satellites.
In the foreseeable future, gap between China and the US cannot be eliminated by China's development of space_weapons_@WEA," the editorial said.
"The US advantage is overwhelming.
Before strategic uncertainties between China and the US can disappear, China urgently needs to have an outer space trump card", it said.
"China's_public_policy_@DOC is peaceful use of space, which is also China's real desire.
China has no interest in launching a large-scale_space_race_@PROG with the US.
China and Russia jointly initiated a programme to avoid an arms race in_@REL outer space in 2008, but this proposal was refused by the US", it said.
"Against this background, it is necessary for China to have the ability to strike US satellites.
This deterrent can provide strategic protection to Chinese satellites and the whole country's national security", it said.
"The US will continue to harass and even obstruct China's developing of its space capabilities.
China should make tactical adjustments to reduce trouble.
It is key for China to have the ability of strategic retaliation.
It is a safeguard for China to deter the US from taking risky action against China in this period of great transition," it said.The planned test by China comes in the backdrop of the launch of China's own GPS called_@REL BeiDou_Navigation_Satellite_System_(BDS)_@WEA currently_being_used_by_@REL Chinese_military_@ORG and a number of official bodies.China plans to launch 20 more satellites to improve its functioning.Some US officials suspect China may want to go higher than it did in either 2007 or 2010, targeting an object 12,000 miles or so above Earth's surface.This ability to reach Medium-Earth_Orbit_(MEO)_@TECH could_theoretically_put_the_constellation_of_@REL US_Global_Positioning_System_navigational_satellites_@WEA at risk, a report in Space.Com said.
"But there are good reasons for China not to destroy a satellite at this orbit, including that China plans to use this part of space," Kulacki wrote.
"Creating debris, as it now understands, would threaten its own satellites.
Over the next several years, China plans to place more than 20 new navigational satellites in_@REL MEO," he wrote.Kulacki urged_@REL the Obama_Administration_@ORG to attempt_to_dissuade_China_from_conducting_@REL any more destructive ASAT_test_@PROGs.Both the United States and the Soviet Union abandoned such tests as their space_programmes_@PROG matured, he notes.
"Hopefully, China will eventually come to a similar conclusion," Kulacki wrote adding that "beginning a meaningful bilateral dialogue on space security between the United States and China could hasten the day.

Frank Wolf (R-Va. ), chairman_@REL of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds_@REL the U.S._space_agency_@ORG, that they support his panel's approach tocommercial_crew_vehicle_@WEA development.
"It seems unlikely that NASA_@ORG will receive significant budgetary relief in the foreseeable future," the three retired astronauts wrote in a May 4 letter to Wolf.
"Consequently, it is mandatory to maximize return on the limited funds available to access low Earth orbit.
An early downselect would seem to be prudent in order to maximize the possibility of developing a crew-carrying_spacecraft_@WEA in time to be operationally useful.
"House members are scheduled to debate the Wolf_panel_@ORG's response to NASA_@ORG's fiscal 2013 budget request on Tuesday.
Report language accompanying the Wolf bill, which was approved by the full_House_Appropriations_Committee_@ORG, calls for "an immediate downselect to a single competitor or, at most, the execution of a leader-follower_paradigm_@DOC in which NASA_@ORG makes one large award to a main commercial partner and a second small award to a backup partner.
"NASA_@ORG prefers to maintain competition among companies vying for funds under its commercial crew development (CCDev) seed-money effort as long as possible, in the belief that it will ultimately cost less to develop a vehicle that way.
Under pressure from some of the CCDev competitors, the agency also opted to continue the program under Space_Act_Agreements_@DOC, rather than using the more restrictive Federal_Acquisition_Regulation_(FAR)_@DOC approach.Wolf's panel argued that a quick downselect would allow NASA_@ORG to move_back_to_@REL the FAR procurement approach and avoid a complicated transition from funding more than one company under the Space Act to a FAR procurement.
The three Apollo commanders, who earlier_urged_<ORG>Congress_@ORG to resist</REL> White_House_@ORG plans to hand off human access to the private sector, agreed that a Space Act procurement "would be unlikely to provide the documentation that we normally depend upon to provide high confidence in reaching our technical goals.
""We all agree that our country has painted itself into a corner and does not now, nor will for many years, have a U.S. government craft suitable for carrying cargo or crew to the International_Space_Station_@ORG," the astronauts wrote.
"The reputation of our country and the potential liability associated with carrying United States and international crews to and from the ISS dictates that we do everything possible to ensure that any commercial crew service meets standards equal to those that we would enforce would the craft be government owned and operated.
"docno: 114762 Missile_ThreatA_Project_@PROG of the George C. Marshall and Claremont InstitutesRussia to create new missiles to compete with U.S.RBTHPosted on January 9, 2013 by editorIt looks like the Russian_military_@ORG and the military-industrial complex have_decided_to_prepare_seriously_for_@REL overcoming the American_missile_defense_system_@WEA.
Work is underway simultaneously on two strategic_missiles_@WEA of different classes.According to Sergei_Karakaev_@P1, the commander_@REL of Russiaa  s Strategic Missile Forces, these is a heavy, 100-ton, liquid-propellant intercontinental ballistic_missile_@WEA (ICBM) that should_outperform_@REL the world's most powerful R-36M_@WEA2 Voevoda (NATO_@ORG reporting name: SS-18 Satan), and a solid-fuel ICBM scheduled_to_replace_@REL the fifth-generation Yars systems (the RS-24 and the Topol-M).
'Since the potential of solid-fuel_ICBMs_@WEA could_become_insufficient_for_@REL overcoming the American_missile_defense_system_@WEA going forward, a heavy_liquid-propellant_ICBM_@WEA is needed to perform this task.
Such an ICBM will_allow_the_creation_of_@REL a non-nuclear,_high-precision,_strategic_weapon_@WEA with a practically global range, unless the United States abandons its program,' Karakaev said.This is the first time Russia has spoken about creating a new solid-fuel_missile_@WEA.
According to Gen._Karakaev_@P1, several launches of a prototype of this missile took place in 2012' most recently on Oct. 24.This puts an end to the debate on whether Russia's_Strategic_Missile_Forces_@ORG need a heavyweight liquid-propellant missile.Russia undertook a large-scale modernization of the Topol_family_@WEA in the 1990s and adopted the Topol-M_silos_@WEA (NATO_@ORG reporting_name_@REL: SS-27_@WEA) in 2000, followed_by_@REL the mobile_Topol-M2_@WEA several years ago.
It is the new_Topol_@WEA and the newly adopted RS-24_Yars_@WEA that will_be_gradually_replacing_@REL the decommissioned, first-generation, solid-fuel_missile_@WEAs.But liquid-propellant missiles still_form_the_backbone_of_@REL the strategic_deterrence_forces_@ORG: the UR-100N_@WEA (NATO_@ORG reporting_name_@REL: SS-19_Stiletto_@WEA) and the D_-36M_@WEA (U.S._Department_of_Defense_@ORG and NATO_@ORG reporting_name_@REL: SS-18 Satan).
These, however, are obsolete and will have to be retired over the next few years.New missiles have been slow in arriving to the Russia's_armed_forces_@ORG.
According to an estimate by Leonid_Kalashnikov_@P1, deputy_chairman_@REL of the State_Duma_Defense_Committee_@ORG, Russia could receive 100-105 new ICBMs by 2015.
If the bet remains on, the single-warhead_Topol-M_@WEA and the three-warhead_Yars-24_@WEA would_be_able_to_carry_@REL a total of 110-115 warheads_@WEA.
At the same time, the United States is planning to deploy 900 ballistic_missile_@WEA interceptors worldwide by 2015.The United States withdrew from the 1972_Anti-Ballistic_Missile_Treaty_@DOC in 2001 and is no longer limited by any restrictions on building up the quantity and quality of such means.
According to Karakaev, it is possible that America could deploy anti-missile_defenses_@TECH in space.Russia's military and political leadership was counting on successful negotiations with the United States on missile defense.
However, the negotiations have ended in a deadlock; Washington's persistent deployment of surface- and sea-based anti-missile_defenses_@TECH, coupled with a general deterioration of bilateral relations, have forced the Russian leadership to consider more decisive actions.This is where the idea of a missile capable of carrying a dividing warhead with a large number of individually targeted blocks (which would also have a long range) originated.
Russia already has such missiles' the above-mentioned liquid-propellant UR-100N_@WEA and R-36M_@WEA.
However, these missiles have been on combat duty since the late 1980s, and their service life is nearing an end.Development of new missiles was suspended in the 1990s, when the Strategic Missile Forces were expected to be fully converted to lightweight, solid-fuel_missile_@WEA complexes.
However, lightweight_missiles_@WEA have_not_been_able_to_become_a_full-fledged_replacement_for_@REL liquid-propellant giants.According to Yuri_Zaitsev_@P1, an expert_at_the_Academy_of_Engineering_Sciences_@P2, 'It's unlikely that the lightweight_Topol-M_@WEA and the Bulava_@WEA [ a new sea-based_solid-fuel_Topol-M_based_missile_@WEA ] could serve as a worthy substitute for the decommissioned_missiles_@WEA.
'Nonetheless, Russia is not planning to abandon its solid-fuel_missile_@WEAs either.
Solid-fuel_missiles_@WEA are_the_best_match_for_@REL mobile_complexes_@WEA.
This means that Russia will continue developing a replacement for both types of its active-duty missiles.This entry was posted in News and tagged ICBM , R-36M_@WEA2 Voevoda , Russia , SS-18 Satan , Topol , by editor .

"The research, conducted in the fourth quarter of 2012, suggests that the market for services provided by business and technology consultancies to develop and implement the systems required to generate data insights, is growing at a compound annual rate of more than 15%.
The global market for these services will almost double over the next four years, from an estimated $54.5 billion in 2012 to $96.9 billion in 2016, according to the Pringle & Company report.The overall business_intelligence_@TECH and analytics market, made up of both software and services, was worth $79 billion in 2012, and will now grow at a rate of approximately 16% annually to reach $143.3 billion in 2016.Although enterprises have been grappling with big_data_@TECH headaches for years, the recognition that CIOs need external help to deliver rapidly accessible business insights to everyday users is new.
"Across the whole spectrum of business_intelligence_@TECH, analytics is the area of most interest at the moment," said Tom_Pringle_@P1, author_@P2 of the report.
"While organizations have always been interested in understanding operational performance, CIOs are now seeing more business-led demand -- from the board level down to individual business heads .

These include providing flexible mobile accessibility across a growing number of devices; compensating for users' lack of data literacy; achieving the required speed of information_delivery_@TECH; and ensuring the quality and integrity of source data, Pringle said.As they seek to satisfy growing demand for timely and specific business insight, CIOs must draw on a range of services.
These range from assessing and improving the quality of target data sources and making resulting analyses comprehensible to users, to determining the exact needs of users and ensuring that the particular information they require can be delivered to them at the point of need.The Pringle_report_@DOC highlights the indispensable role of external services right across the board -- from management consultancies to technical, deployment and maintenance providers -- in developing an organization's capability to harness the value of data.
Its conclusions support the general rule that for every dollar spent on software for business_intelligence_@TECH, more than two are spent on external service providers, as companies seek to plug gaps in their internal data_analysis_@TECH capabilities and associated IT skills.The telecommunications and financial services sectors have long exhibited strong demand for external services, but interest is now growing across a number of other sectors, including healthcare , as providers seek to improve patient care by establishing a more holistic view of patients, and travel , as airlines, for example, try to sustain the customer experience yet counteract rising costs.Recognizing the opportunity, outsourced service providers are now ramping up their services and new players are entering the market, Pringle said.
"Business_intelligence_@TECH, and specifically data_analytics_@TECH, is one of the highest growth areas in IT generally.
What's particularly interesting as service providers tap into this opportunity is the entry of non-traditional players.
Among them are industry professionals with a lot of operational experience.
They are able to complement data and technology experience with a deep knowledge of how particular organizations need to use data for strategic and competitive advantage.
Their involvement, alongside data experts, helps deliver the speed of results that is so critical now.
Even very large firms don't have all of the skills they need in house, so it makes sense to partner with relevant experts.
"Companies shouldn't underestimate the groundwork needed to enable more dynamic, business-driven data_analytics_@TECH, Pringle added.
"The 'bigger' and more strategic data becomes, the more important it is that the quality is good," he noted.
"Presentation is important too, as most users won't be data experts. "
To this end, technology providers need to work harder to hide the complexity of the data, he said, so that only unambiguous and relevant content is served up to users -- aiding their efficiency, rather than distracting them further.Pointing to CIOs' priorities over the year ahead, Pringle concluded, "To avoid projects that spiral out of control, organizations should start small, focusing on where the demand is coming from in the business: is it to understand sales performance in more detail, for example, or to analyze costs in the supply chain  The sensible advice is probably to look at specific issues rather than take a big-bang approach -- then, if data quality turns out to be an issue, you might be able to get away with a fairly packaged service from an IT provider.
"Emerging database_technology_@TECH promises to automate more analysis.
Here's where it could replace relational systems.

The company has recently concluded testing on a 500-watt propane-powered_unit_@WEA and is planning to demonstrate a 1-kilowatt systems by the end of this year.
"Being able to use accessible fuel is key to the success of the fuel_cell_industry_@ORG, and we've focused on our technology's ability to use readily available gaseous and liquid fuels for commercial and military applications," Dr._Caine_Finnerty_@P1, president_@REL of WATT Fuel Cell said.
Propane and natural gas will be used commercially, while liquid fuels such_as_@REL Diesel (D2) and JP-8 will be suitable for the military.As part of the system's commercialization WATT has recently refined its patented cell manufacturing process, substantially reducing production times while increasing part quality, performance and yield.
"Our process not only makes cost-effective stack manufacturing a reality, but also permits manufacturing scalability to quickly flex, matching market demand," said Benjamin_Emley_@P1, technology_director_@P2 at the company.
According to Emley, the company is presently scaling into full-rate production at its manufacturing facility on Long Island.The SOFC_@TECH working principleThe SOFC_@TECH working principleEarlier this week Parker_Hannifin_@ORG and WATT Fuel Cell Corp. embarked_on_@REL a strategic licensing and supply agreement to bring WATT's propane-driven based products to commercial markets.
The agreement will provide Parker's an exclusive license of WATT Fuel Cell's_@REL low-cost balance-of-plant (BoP) technology and exclusive stack supply for use in 500 to 3000 watt RV, marine and over-the-road trucking markets.
Parker will_manufacture_@REL the BoP and controls and also integrate the fuel cell stacks into complete, packaged SOFC_@TECH products.While the agreement with Parker aims at the commercial sector, the SOFC_@TECH fuel-cell has many military applications as well, particularly with systems operating on JP-8_fuel_@WEA.
With such capability the fuel cell provides a powerful, quiet and logistically efficient energy source for various users, including robotics or unattended communications devices.
WATT Fuel Cell has already integrated systems operating on both gaseous and liquid fuel.
The fuel cell system replaces batteries offering six times the capacity for a given net weight (the weight of batteries providing less than 200 Wh/kg can be replaced by JP-8_fuel_@WEA cell driving more than 12,000 Wh/kg).
Key for performance improvement is the reduction in the size of the fuel cell and its electronic control circuits.Typical applications of SOFC_@TECH employ cylindrical ducts flowing the fuel and air, interconnected to react and generate electricity.Micro-tubular SOFC_@TECH fuel cell design geometries promise relatively fast start up times, typically on the order of minutes.WATT Fuel Cell has identified several key applications within the military including UAVs_@WEA, UGV's, battery chargers and primary power to forward deployed forces.
"We have taken a simplified approach to system and stack design in order to streamline production and product support.
Reduction in system cost and standardization of componentry across various power platforms will enable us to provide a better product to the end user" Emley explained.Based on the content of this article, you might be interested in the following posts:Compact JP-8 Diesel-Powered Fuel-Cell Demonstrates Long Operation Durability Compact JP-8 Diesel-Powered Fuel-Cell Demonstrates LongHorizon Fuel Cell Tested on Elbit Systems' Skylark I-LE Mini UAV Horizon Fuel Cell Tested on Elbit Systems' Skylark I-LEBirdEye 650LE Mini-UAV Uses Fuel Cell to Fly Six HourStalker EX Mini-UAV Set for Eight Hour Endurance Missions Stalker EX Mini-UAV Set for Eight Hour Endurance Missions6th Annual Military Energy Alternatives ConferenceRelated Posts6th Annual Military Energy Alternatives ConferenceSkylark 1LE Adapts for the U.S._MilitaryTailoring_Unmanned_Platforms_@WEA for New MissionsGlobe-i Zooming in to a "Window of Interest"Copyright   2013 Defense_Update_@TECH - Military Technology & Defense News.

"An earlier Sandia study concluded that such a UAV could be tested within a decade.
It will not be, because it is nuclear-powered, and politics make it impossible.
But the technical and operational case is powerful.Non-solar_@TECH-powered UAVs_@WEA, such as Boeing's_hydrogen-fueled_Phantom_Eye_@WEA and Aurora_Flight_Sciences'_Orion_@WEA, are expected to deliver multi-day endurance.
But they cannot carry large payloads or provide much electrical power, and are slow, so have to be forward-based.
They are also restricted to propeller propulsion, which makes stealth unattainable.The Sandia-Northrop activity is linked to studies of nuclear-powered UAVs_@WEA in the U.S._Air_Force_@ORG that started in the mid-1990s, not long after the Advanced_Airborne_Reconnaissance_System_@WEA, a conventionally_powered_long-endurance_stealth_drone_@WEA planned_in_the_1980s_to_track_@REL Soviet mobile_nuclear_missiles_@WEA, was terminated.Sandia was heavily involved by 2001.

According to Sandia, building a modern nuclear-turbojet_engine_@WEA "would not be an R&D_project_@PROG," the CSBA report stated, "but rather an engineering development effort that could culminate in a flight test within a decade.

Marshall and Claremont InstitutesRussia Might Still Use Sea-Fired_Nuclear_Cruise_MissilesChris_@WEA SchneidmillerPosted on January 15, 2013 by editorJan.
14, 2013 - WASHINGTON - There is cause to suspect that Russia might be deploying some number of sea-launched_cruise_missiles_@WEA tipped_with_@REL nuclear warheads_@WEA, two decades after the United States put its version of the weapon into storage, issue experts say.The Kremlin_@ORG might also be developing a next-generation version of that same missile type as part of its broader nuclear forces modernization, according to some observers.If true, the missiles could present a complication to future U.S.-Russian arms control negotiations - and a stealthy threat in the unlikely event of a nuclear conflict.
'The sky is not falling.
I don't think that they're on the verge of deploying large numbers of new nuclear-armed_cruise_missiles_@WEA,' said arms_control_specialist_@REL Jeffrey_Lewis_of_the_James_Martin_Center_for_Nonproliferation_Studies_@P1.
'But it's something that's worth taking seriously and thinking about.
And, if one is committed to doing more in the arms control field, this is a question that is going to come up.
'The United States definitively took its sole line of nuclear sea-launched_cruise_missiles_@WEA, the Tomahawk_land-attack_system_@WEA , off deployment in the early 1990s.
Russia's management of an arsenal with various types of such weapons has been less clear, according to Lewis.The_U.S.-Soviet_Strategic_Arms_Reduction_Treaty_@DOC signed in July 1991 addressed only the class of weapons that generally_have_greater_ranges_and_explosive_yield_than_@REL tactical_nuclear_arms_@WEA intended for battlefield use.
However, the sides separately agreed to field no more than 880 nuclear-armed sea-launched_cruise_missiles_@WEA and to issue yearly declarations on the deployment counts, Lewis said.Just a few months later, President_George_H.W.Bush_@P1 announced unilateral pullbacks of tactical_nuclear_arms_@WEA under which the Navy_@ORG would_during_'normal_circumstances'_not_carry_@REL nonstrategic_nuclear_missiles_@WEA on surface_vessels_@WEA or attack_submarines_@WEA.At the time, the United States held about 350 Tomahawk_nuclear_cruise_missiles_@WEA that could be launched from sea against land targets, according to Hans_Kristensen_@P1, director_@REL of the Nuclear_Information_Project_@PROG for the Federation_of_American_Scientists_@ORG.
The Navy_@ORG, prior to the White_House_@ORG order, kept_about_100_of_the_missiles_on_@REL attack_submarines_@WEA and other naval_vessels_@WEA on a regular basis, he said.The Soviets - and later the Russians - held a number of dual-capable_cruise_missiles_@WEA for_deployment_on_@REL submarines and surface_vessels_@WEA, but only the SS-N-21_@WEA was_intended_as_@REL a land-attack_weapon_@WEA, according to Kristensen.
Production and deployment figures, though, are hard to come by.
'This is Russian nuclear_weapons_@WEA.
There's so much uncertainty,' he said.While then-Kremlin_@ORG leaders Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris_Yeltsin_@P1 responded to Bush's move by pledging their own tactical_weapons_@WEA rollbacks, they did not 'unambiguously commit' to pulling nuclear-armed sea-launched_cruise_missiles_@WEA from attack_submarines_@WEA, Lewis said.The governments in Moscow and Washington never released details of the cruise-missile_declarations_@DOC, which are_no_longer_required_following_@REL the START_treaty_@DOC's expiration in 2009.
'It seems likely that Russia declared zero, because if it hadn't declared zero it may very well have turned into a political issue,' James_Acton_@P1, a senior_associate_@REL for nuclear_policy_@DOC with the Carnegie_Endowment_for_International_Peace_@ORG, said in an interview.Lewis concurred.
'I suspect the Soviets (and Russians) did, in fact, declare zero, if only because I would expect any other number to leak,' he wrote in an October post on the Arms Control Wonk blog.The Obama_administration_@ORG announced_the_decommissioning_of_@REL the sea-launched_nuclear_Tomahawks_@WEA in its 2010_Nuclear_Posture_Review_@DOC.
Russia, though, might be going in the other direction, Lewis_said.Then-Russian_Defense_Minister_Sergei_Ivanov_@P1 stated in 2006 that nuclear_weapons_@WEA were_being_carried_by_@REL three 'multipurpose (i.e.
attack)' submarines, rather than the ballistic-missile_underwater_craft_@WEA, Lewis stated_in_@REL his blog post.
News_reports_@DOC in recent years have suggested similar deployments.Kristensen, though, said that Ivanov's statement was indicative only of 'fumbled language' rather than demonstrating Russian nuclear cruise missiles were at sea.Russia has also faced scrutiny in the last couple years over efforts to sell a short-range_cruise_missile_system_@WEA that is designed to be hidden and fired from a shipping container.
The weapon is manufactured by the same firm that makes the SS-N-21_@WEA cruise missile.
'Although I suspect the intended audience for the containerized_cruise_missiles_@WEA largely comprise tin-pot dictators some Russians apparently see stealth and mobility as a selling point,' Lewis told GSN .
'For Russia itself, submarines are probably the platform of choice.
'The nation's ongoing military_modernization_projects_@PROG encompass_@REL a new attack submarine and new cruise missiles, according to Lewis, who directs_his_organization's_@REL East_Asia_Nonproliferation_Program_@PROG.
'They're working on a new cruise missile.
It's probably for air delivery, but one could imagine them converting them over' for sea deployment, he said.Among the rumors regarding Russia's cruise missiles is that a nuclear form of the SS-N-30_@WEA is being prepared for the Yasen-class_atomic_submarine_Severodvinsk_@WEA , Kristensen said.
"In 1991, the United States and the then-Soviet Union, as a political commitment, voluntarily_agreed_to_cease_deploying_@REL any nuclear sea-launched_cruise_missiles_@WEA on surface_ships_@WEA or multipurpose_submarines_@WEA.
The United States has no definitive information that the Russian Federation is_not_abiding_by_@REL this political commitment,' Pentagon_spokeswoman_Lt._Col._Monica_Matoush_@P1 said in a prepared statement to GSN.The Russian Embassy in Washington said last week it had no information on the matter.Experts acknowledged that the information is circumstantial rather than definitive, but said Moscow might see cause for fielding nuclear sea-launched_cruise_missiles_@WEA or building new ones.Russian leaders seemingly believe that cruise missiles and other naval nuclear_weapons_@WEA have a role in countering stronger U.S. and NATO_@ORG sea power, Kristensen stated by e-mail.
'Sea-launched_cruise_missiles_@WEA provide a relatively stealthy and accurate option to hold at risk a variety of regional targets,' Lewis said in an e-mailed follow-up to a telephone interview.Having the missiles ready for use could be a hedge against burgeoning deployment of U.S. missile_defense_assets_@WEA in Europe, Acton added.
Submarines could fire a sea-launched_nuclear_cruise_missile_@WEA from a significant distance - the SS-N-21_@WEA has a range of about 1,860 miles - and the weapon would_have_a_greater_chance_of_reaching_its_target_than_@REL an air-dropped_bomb_@WEA, he said.
'We're dealing with very low-probability, high-consequence scenarios,' Acton added.
'But if you're thinking of what nuclear_weapons_@WEA are of more or less concern, then those features make Russian sea-launched_cruise_missiles_@WEA of more concern.
'He said that development of new sea-based_nuclear_cruise_missiles_@WEA would not necessarily be based on 'cold-blooded' Russian strategizing.
Rather, they could derive from jockeying for influence between various weapons design bureaus.The_missiles_@WEA could pose a threat to Obama_administration_@ORG hopes for a follow-up to the New_START_nuclear_arms_control_treaty_@DOC that would_address_tactical_as_well_as_@REL strategic_nuclear_arms_@WEA , Lewis said.
The United States and Russia began implementing New START, which caps_deployed_@REL long-range warheads_@WEA at 1,550 and delivery_vehicles_@WEA at 700, in early 2011.Russia deploys various types of nonstrategic nuclear_weapons_@WEA , but could be particularly reluctant to allow inspection of vessels that might carry sea-launched_nuclear_cruise_missile_@WEAs as well as conventional_weapons_@WEA.
'Once the Russians spend a bazillion dollars on a new cruise missile, the chance of an arms_control_agreement_@DOC is much, much lower,' Lewis said.
'So I'm definitely engaging in the debate in anticipation of a threat rather than in response to [one].
'An effort to resume SLCM data exchanges could help.
This might lead to other confidence-building measures and potentially some sort of agreement on the Russian weapons, Lewis has argued.The likelihood of Moscow and Washington actually agreeing to such measures in the existing strategic climate, though, is 'probably zero,' he said.This entry was posted in Publications and tagged Russia , SS-N-21_@WEA , SS-N-30_@WEA , Tomahawk , NATO_@ORG , Nuclear_Weapons_@WEA , START_Treaty_@DOC by editor .

Nevertheless, there's no evidence that consumers are using Internet sites to diagnose themselves instead of consulting physicians, said Susannah_Fox_@P1, associate_director_@REL of the Pew_Internet_Project_@PROG, in_an_interview_with_@REL InformationWeek Healthcare .Overall, the study found, 81% of American adults had used the Internet, and 72% of Internet users had sought health information online in the previous 12 months.
Fifty-nine percent of online health information seekers tried to identify what kind of medical condition they had.Women outnumbered men within this group, and people who were young, white, high-income and highly educated were more likely than others to diagnose themselves or others on the Web, the survey found.Of the online diagnosers, 46% said that the condition they tried to diagnose needed the attention of a doctor, 38% said it could be taken care of at home, and 11% said it was either both or in between.Fifty-three percent of online diagnosers said_they'd_talked_with_@REL a medical professional about what they'd found online.
Forty-one percent said that a clinician had confirmed their suspicions, and another 2% said that a clinician had partially confirmed them.
According to 18% of these people, a medical professional did not agree or offered a different opinion about the condition, and 1% said the clinician could not diagnose it.
The rest did not visit a medical professional.
[ To see how patient engagement can help transform medical care, check out 5 Healthcare Tools To Boost Patient Involvement .
]The likelihood of a consumer going online to diagnose a condition fell significantly with age: As a percentage of all U.S. adults, only 29% in the 50-64 age group and 13% in the 65+ age group did so.
However, among the 55% of Internet users who sought information about a specific disease or medical problem -- not necessarily for diagnostic reasons -- the age difference was much lower, with 43% of seniors going online for this purpose.
"Internet access drives information access," Fox said, noting that the baby boomers now moving into the ranks of seniors "are_swelling_the_ranks_of_@REL the Internet users.
If you look at the group of people 72 and older, Internet use drops precipitously.
"For the first time, the Pew survey compared the percentage of insured people to the percentage of uninsured people who went online to look up health information.
They found a difference between the percentages of people trying to diagnose an illness online, versus the percentages looking up health information in general.
"There is no statistically significant difference between those who have health insurance and those who do not when it comes to using the Internet to figure out an illness," the report found.However, 75% of insured Internet users sought any kind of health information online, compared to 59% of uninsured Internet users.
Even more striking, 60% of the insured looked up information about medical conditions, vs. 35% of the uninsured.Fox speculated that insured people are more connected to the healthcare system than the uninsured and therefore more likely to look up health information online.
But she did not draw any conclusion from the fact that just as many uninsured as insured people try to diagnose diseases on the Web, yet fewer of the uninsured visit physicians.
Other factors besides insurance may be involved, she said.
For example, some people may be using websites to look up health problems that don't require a doctor's attention.The Pew survey also found that when people did consult a physician, only 1% did so online and 8% did so both online and offline.
In contrast, Manhattan_Research_@ORG recently reported that 39% of physicians said they e-mailed with patients.
Fox said it's possible that some doctors may go online with a few of their patients and that some practices may just have patients fill out forms online.
But the bottom line is that "a very small group of consumers said that when they had a health issue, they could contact their doctor online," she said.On another front, the Pew report noted_that_20%_of_@REL Internet users had_consulted_@REL online reviews of particular drugs or medical treatments, doctors, hospitals or other providers.
And just 30% of Internet users had_posted_@REL online reviews of healthcare services or providers.Fsox wasn't sure why so many fewer people use or post healthcare_reviews_@DOC than use or post them in other fields such as travel, hospitality and consumer products.
"But it's important for people to understand that there are just a few voices that are amplified [in reviews].
That's a challenge for consumers, doctors and hospitals.

Pat_Quinn_@P1's failure to reform the program, which is nearly $100 billion in debt.Bob Williams_@P1, president_@REL of State Budget Solutions (SBS), says Illinois will be the first of many states to fail if something is not done to quell rising retirement costs for state employees and teachers.SBS, a conservative nonprofit, has studied the fiscal problems of all 50 states and sees one common denominator to curbing pension shortfalls: Converting_@REL defined-benefit_retirement_plans_@DOC in which employees receive set benefits regardless of a state's financial health to the defined-contribution plans common_in_@REL the private sector.
"The only solution is a 401(k)-type, defined-contribution system," Williams_@P1 said.
"hese defined-benefit systems are underfunded woefully, and unfortunately, too many states aren't waking up to reality.
"Illinois already supplies defined contribution plans to state_@REL university employees through its TIAA-CREF_program_@PROG.
That retirement system is the healthiest in the state since lawmakers are forced to match employee contributions in a timely manner even as they have ignored and delayed full contributions to the defined benefit systems.Illinois has the lowest credit rating of any state and is in danger of being reduced to junk bond status because its pension liabilities are 39 percent funded .
That is less than half of what accounting professionals consider healthy.
The TIAA-CREF_system_@DOC, by contrast, enjoys the highest credit rating from each of the four major rating agencies.
"The higher-ed system has performed very well because members are involved directly," Williams_@P1 said.
"If the legislature did not fully fund its contribution, the faculty would immediately know about it.
Whereas in a [defined-benefit] plan, they assume the money is going to there-it's obviously not.
"Williams_@P1' proposal is gaining steam among some political insiders in Illinois but reform-minded Democrats, including_@REL Gov._Quinn_@P1, are cool to the idea.
The governor has proposed a number of smaller reforms to cut back on the system's $97 billion debt to no avail.
Democrats, who hold_super_majorities_in_@REL both legislative branches, refused to vote on his lame duck push to create a super-committee to resolve the crisis.Conservative activists from_@REL the Illinois_Policy_Institute_@ORG, a state think tank, opposed Quinn's plan because he seemed unwilling to push for major reforms.
"It's clear that Pat_Quinn_@P1 does not understand the full scope of the problem.
He's just flailing around," said Jonathan_Ingram_@P1, IPI's_director_@REL of health policy and pension_reform_@PROG.
"Defined-benefit plans are outdated, virtually_unheard_of_@REL in private sector and for good reason.
They assume that you can predict what the [stock] market's going to look like in 30 years, what the life expectancy is going to be; there are too many variables to account for.
"Unions have fought against defined-contribution reforms, a major reason Quinn has not entertained the idea.
Anders_Lindall_@P1, spokesman_@REL for the politically powerful_American_Federation_of_State,_County,_and_Municipal_Employees_@P3, said conservatives are trying to exploit the crisis by blaming employees rather than politicians for the funding shortfall.
"They won't be happy until no worker has a defined-benefit pension," he said.
"They want everyone to have private 401(k) accounts that have failed to provide an adequate retirement savings for the American middle class.
"Defined benefit systems cut costs to taxpayers since pooled money can be managed at a cheaper cost than individual retirement accounts, according to Lindall.
The accounts also protect employees by putting their money in the hands of professional investors.The average 401(k) for households of people ages 45-54 lost about 7 percent of its value during the Great Recession, while households with younger people (ages 35-44) more prone to risky investments lost about 20 percent of their savings, according to U.S._News_and_World_Report_@ORG .Public pensions were not immune from the downturn.
The Teacher's_Retirement_System_@PROG , the largest in the state, lost 5 percent of its value in FY 2008 followed by a 23 percent decline in 2009 before rebounding with a 13 percent gain in 2010.Ingram said the decline is indicative of the risks inherent in underfunding the system.
Illinois assumed its system would grow by 8.5 percent every year for decades.
Such optimistic assumptions allow lawmakers to pay less into the system but also force state money managers to invest in more volatile assets, such as stocks, rather than lower yielding but less risky fixed income assets.
"They're forced to reach for higher and riskier terms; there's no security," Williams_@P1 said.The investment losses led Illinois to reduce its assumed rate of return to 7.75 percent in four of the state's five systems-teachers reduced their rate to 8 percent.
The lowered rates are still 22 percent higher than the average return of the best performing private sector pension systems at the start of the recession.Reformers should rely on bluntness to counteract union influence and political timidity, Williams_@P1 said.
"We have to be honest with the workers and let them know that as things stand, there won't be any money left for them down the road," he said.
"There's only so much you can get from taxpayers.

Elsewhere, the American_administration_@ORG still has to win over nations that are reluctant to risk the economic punishment of being seen as allied with a U.S._strategy_@DOC to constrain China's rise.
"If you stand still in Asia, you're going to fall behind the rise of China," said Robert_S._Ross_@P1, a professor_@REL of Chinese_foreign_policy_at_Boston_College_@P2.
"We're not going to stand still, but we can improve our rhetoric and disentangle from these territorial disputes.
"Obama, who's_sometimes_called_@REL the "first Pacific president" because of his childhood years in Indonesia and his upbringing in Hawaii, clearly has the political will to make Asia the focus of U.S._policy_@DOC.
More than half of American_naval_assets_@WEA are deployed in the region, the administration has signed fresh_defense_agreements_@DOC with Asian_partners_@ORG and there's been a marked increase in high-profile U.S. state visits to promote trade and diplomacy.In November, Obama made a historic trip to the former pariah state of Myanmar, his fourth high-profile visit to Asia in as many years, and his secretaries_of_state_and_defense_@REL, Hillary_Clinton_@P1 and Leon Panetta, have been frequent visitors, as have numerous more junior diplomats and defense_officials_@P2.
"There's no comparison," said Daniel_Sneider_@P1, the associate_director_@REL for research at the Walter_H._Shorenstein_Asia-Pacific_Research_Center_@ORG at_@REL Stanford_University_@ORG in California, commenting on the Obama_administration_@ORG's approach versus that of its predecessor.
"These guys have been there.
They've thought about it more.
They have a broad strategy.
"Sneider, however, saw risk to that strategy in the pull of crises elsewhere.
"It has to be backed up by devoting real resources in the end," he said of an Asia focus.
"Any new engagement of U.S._forces_in_the_Middle_East_@ORG will immediately undermine this policy.
"Even in tightly knit Washington policymaking_circles_@ORG, there's confusion over how to pursue this new Asia focus, starting with what to call it.A first suggestion, "forward-deployed diplomacy," was jettisoned as too militaristic, especially when it comes to prickly superpower China.
Then came "the Asia pivot," which rankled Middle_Eastern_and_European_allies_@ORG, who thought it suggested abandonment of their regions.
The White_House_@ORG now prefers "the rebalancing," while some policymakers are starting to use the blunter "return to Asia.
"The semantics matter, analysts said, when one of the most sensitive parts of the plan includes dealing with Chinese suspicions that the maneuvering is intended to blunt China's economic and military rise.Any hope of a deeper, more complex U.S. focus on Asia, analysts who study the region say, hinges on how the second Obama_administration_@ORG tweaks the long-standing_policy_@DOC toward China that some dub "congagement," an attempt to blend containment of growing Chinese_military_@ORG power with engagement on trade and diplomatic issues.Justin Logan_@P1, the director_@REL of foreign policy studies at_@REL the Cato_Institute_@ORG, a libertarian_research_center_@ORG in Washington, argued in a report this month, called "China, America and the Pivot to Asia," that few are fooled that U.S._policy_@DOC isn't really about containment and that the United States should step back from involving itself in "every diplomatic flare-up" so that it retains greater distance from the squabbling parties.
"If the Chinese were getting up in our face saying, 'We're putting 60 percent of our naval assets in the Caribbean and developing military_alliances_@ORG with Cuba and Venezuela, and none of this has anything to do with the United States,' no one would believe that," Logan_@P1 said.He suggests offloading some of the security responsibilities to allied nations such as Japan, South Korea and India, and encouraging talks among those nations without U.S. officials present, let alone in the lead.
Logan_@P1 said it was healthy for there to be some doubts about exactly where U.S. forces would be committed in any regional flare-up.
That would encourage nations to avoid such high-stakes disputes in the first place or to look inward for defense_strategies_@DOC and "help minimize free riding," as he put it.Logan_@P1's report describes two polarized camps when it comes to how the U.S. should approach China.
The hawkish policy camp, nicknamed the "dragon slayers," demands a bigger U.S. military presence in Asia to restrict China's sea access and act as a barrier to any bullying of weaker nations.At the other end of the spectrum on China_policy_@DOC are the analysts Logan_@P1 calls_@REL "panda huggers," who are betting that a focus on trade and diplomacy over military might will force China to democratize and become a more trusted U.S. partner.The administration's current plans call for deploying 2,000 Marines to Australia and four coastal combat shipsto Singapore - hardly terrifying prospects for the Chinese, the hawks complain.But critics of the notion that the pivot lacks military chops point out that there's already a huge U.S. military presence in the Asia Pacific, larger than during the most recent Republican administrations.
There are 40,000 American troops in Japan, more than 28,000 in South Korea and 4,500 in Guam, a self-governing U.S. territory.
There are six aircraft_@WEA carrier strike groups and the U.S._Pacific_Fleet_@ORG, which conducts_@REL regular joint_military_exercises_@PROG with Asian allies.When the Obama_administration_@ORG got serious about the pivot in 2010, Boston_College's_Ross_@P1 said, "you couldn't have asked for a more robust strategic presence than we had at the time.
"Obama has made that presence even greater, at the expense of irritating the Chinese without any appreciable strategic benefit.
That includes an increase in a U.S. military presence in South Korea that Obama ordered to reverse President George W. Bush's decision to reduce it by 40 percent - including a cut in joint_military_exercises_@PROG, pulling troops out of the area between the demilitarized zone and Seoul, and announcing that in 2012 the U.S. would hand over wartime operational control to South Korean forces.In contrast, the Obama_administration_@ORG increased troop levels by 10 percent, signed_@REL four new defense agreements with South Korea, increased_the_size_and_scale_of_@REL joint_exercises_@PROG and deferred the handover of operational control of forces until 2015.The moves, Ross said, came at a time when the presumed target of the posturing - North Korea - posed less of a threat than ever when it came to conventional warfare.
"If you're Chinese, you begin to ask yourself why this is happening, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that America's presence in South Korea is not directed at North Korea, but directed at China," Ross said.Obama's picks for secretaries of state and defense, Democrat_John_Kerry_@P1 and Republican_Chuck_Hagel_@P1, have records of moderate stances toward China, which analysts say portends a policy of more engagement - not just with the Chinese, but also with other Asian powers such as Japan, India, Vietnam and South Korea.Kerry, especially, is_familiar_with_Asia_from_his_close_involvement_with_@REL the Senate_Foreign_Relations_Subcommittee_on_East_Asian_and_Pacific_Affairs_@ORG.
"I expect him to pursue an intense strategy of engagement with China, with hedging," Sneider said.
"I expect Kerry to head down a path of trying to engage the new Chinese leadership as far as they're willing to go.
"Analysts said Kerry should make it a priority to draw the U.S. back from involvement in territorial disputes over contested islands while ensuring that a more neutral stance isn't viewed as abandoning important allies.One fight is over the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands; the Chinese call them the Diaoyu Islands.
Taiwan also has staked a claim.
In December, a Chinese government airplane conducted a flyover of the disputed islands, prompting the Japanese to dispatch eight F-15_jets_@WEA and an early-warning aircraft_@WEA in response.The Chinese plane already was gone by then, and the situation cooled until Christmas Eve, when a Chinese coast guard Y-12 aircraft_@WEA switched course to the Senkaku Islands.
Again, the Japanese launched several fighter_jets_@WEA and the Chinese plane left the area.
"People are watching this scrambling of jets, movements of coast_guard_vessels_@WEA around these islands," Sneider said.
"On one hand, the U.S. is going to back the Japanese as our allies.
On the other hand, there's a message to both Japan and China to cool it.
"The other big territorial fight is over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.
They're claimed by China and several other nations: Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Vietnam.After a long-standing hands-off approach marked by American platitudes about "freedom of navigation" and "peaceful resolution," Ross said, the Obama_administration_@ORG jumped into the fray in 2010 by gathering the common claim-holders for talks - but notably excluding China.docno: 123883Army Advances Better_Buying_Power_@DOC(Source: U.S_Army_@ORG; issued January 28, 2013)WASHINGTON --- The U.S._Army_@ORG has_achieved_significant_cost_savings_and_cost_avoidance_as_result_of_its_implementation_of_@REL Better_Buying_Power_@DOC, an initiative led_by_@REL the Office_of_the_Secretary_of_Defense_@ORG aimed_at_improving_the_management_of_@REL acquisition_programs_@PROG, incentivizing competition, eliminating redundancy and achieving the maximum amount of savings, senior service officials explained.In place since 2010, Better_Buying_Power_@DOC, or BBP_@DOC, is also geared toward incentivizing innovation and productivity while improving the capabilities of the acquisition workforce and strengthening the tradecraft of acquisition services, among other things.
"Better_Buying_Power_@DOC has produced large savings.
We're continuously looking to optimize the use of the Army's money," said Tom_Mullins_@P1, <P2>deputy_assistant_secretary_@P2</REL> of the Army for Plans, Programs and Resources.Some of the key tenets of the program include specific efforts to craft and implement policies which build affordability_and_competitive_procurement_strategies_@DOC into_the_structure_of_@REL acquisition_programs_@PROG, said Wimpy_Pybus_@P1, <P2>deputy_assistant_secretary_@P2</REL> of the Army for Acquisition Policy and Logistics.An integral part of the achieved savings can be directly attributed to a portion of BBP_@DOC referred_to_as_@REL the Should-Cost/Will-Cost_program_@PROG; this effort encourages program managers to explore enterprising and innovative program management methods and strategies designed to gain the maximum value from dollars invested, officials said.The "Will-Cost" is the initial baseline or expected cost of a given program or technological development, whereas the "Should-Cost" is, in essence, a lower cost achieved through successful implementation of efforts designed to improve developmental efficiency.The available data from the Army's Should Cost fiscal year 2012 Closeout highlight_substantial_successes_with_@REL the BBP_@DOC program since its inception.
For instance, the Army achieved millions of dollars in savings with the procurement of the Enhanced Performance Round, by lowering the production unit cost of the M855A1/M856A1_lead-free_5.56mm_ammunition_@WEA.
"For years we built 5.56mm_ammo_@WEA with a lead core with brass wrapped around the outside.
It will have less impact on the environment than lead in the long run, lower cost material than lead and an improvement in performance of the round," Mullins explained.Finding and executing the proper contracting mechanism for each program is a considerable part of establishing greater efficiency through BBP_@DOC, Mullins explained.
In fact, the Army's multi-year helicopter_procurement_contracts_@PROG for the CH-47_Chinook_@WEA and the UH-60_Black_Hawk_@WEA are expected to result in savings.
Multi-year contracts improve acquisition efficiency by allowing vendors to establish a stable supply and production schedule, all while securing a lower unit price, he added.
"BBP_@DOC is taking a look at all of your tool kit of things you can do, and then assessing which ones are applicable to the program.
We've seen success in aviation with Black Hawk and Chinook.
The potential savings there are enormous," Mullins added.Other instances of BBP_@DOC success include millions saved on programs such as Excalibur_155m_artillery_rounds_@WEA, modifications to Abrams_tank_and_Stryker_combat_vehicle_procurement_contracts_@PROG designed_to_reduce_costs_and_competitive_acquisition_strategies_with_@REL the Counter Rocket Artillery and Mortar, or CRAM program.BBP_@DOC also plays a role when it comes to the Army's Science and Technology development.
S&T influences a number of the tenants of BBP_@DOC 2.0, specifically achieving affordable programs, controlling costs throughout the product lifecycle and promoting effective competition.Much of what the Army does within the S&T community can help achieve system affordability, said Mary_Miller_@P1, acting deputy_assistant_Secretary_@REL of the Army for Research and Technology.
By designing technologies with reliability and manufacturability in mind, the Army can reduce the cost and time associated with redesign when these technologies transition from the S&T domain into formal programs of record, she said.
This results in lower developmental costs and potentially faster acquisition, she explained.By engaging program managers early in the technology development process and collaboratively defining technology, performance goals and acceptance testing, the Army can facilitate a more successful insertion of mature technology for emerging capabilities, Miller said.
"When developing new capabilities, one of the key things we need to do is make sure we reach technical maturity prior to integration.
This is an essential element of reducing risk and eliminating excess costs," Miller said.The Army, which has had great success thus far with the BBP_@DOC program, is both cataloguing billions in cost savings since the program's inception while simultaneously preparing to implement the next iteration of the initiative, referred to as Better_Buying_Power_@DOC 2.0.
"Better_Buying_Power_@DOC is not a one-time event and you can be assured that neither is BBP_@DOC 2.0, we must make it part of our culture," wrote Frank_Kendall_@P1, under_secretary_@REL of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, in a Nov. 6 memorandum for the Defense acquisition workforce.
"We have more reason than ever to believe that the efficiencies we seek can be realized based on the successes we've accomplished to date.
It is imperative that we stay the course in order to deliver even greater value to our taxpayers and essential capabilities to the warfighters," he wrote in the memo.BBP_@DOC 2.0 seeks to build upon and advance the core tenets of the initial BBP_@DOC effort and further instill a culture of cost-consciousness, increase procurement opportunities for small business and more efficiently execute affordable acquisition_programs_@PROG, officials said.In addition to its many other components, BBP_@DOC 2.0 is also focused on sustainment and life-cycle management, meaning program managers are encouraged to consider the entire life or span of a technology or program's maturation such that they account for its entire life cycle.BBP_@DOC 2.0 also aims to build upon the initial program's emphasis upon incentivizing industry by aligning profitability with contractor performance, officials said.
They added that in fact, this effort speaks to one of DOD's broad BBP_@DOC goals, which is to emphasize that the program is designed to increase productivity and by no means reduce industry profits.-ends-docno: 123889Textron, Rheinmetall_@ORG and Kongsberg Announce_$100_M_Contract_on_@REL Canadian_Forces_TAPV_Program_@PROG(Source: Textron Inc.; issued Jan. 28, 2013)Textron_Systems_Canada_Inc._@ORG, Rheinmetall_@ORG Canada Inc., and Kongsberg_Protech_Systems_(KPS)_Canada_@ORG today announced_@REL a $100 million CAD_contract_@PROG for work to_be_performed_by_@REL KPS_Canada_@ORG on the Canadian_Forces_Tactical_Armoured_Patrol_Vehicle_(TAPV)_project_@PROG.

The NAO makes clear that the MOD_@ORG has:substantially revised the way it compiles and manages the equipment plan and is now approaching the task on a more prudent basis;taken difficult decisions to address what was estimated to be a  74 billion gap between its forecast funding and costs;taken significant positive steps designed to deal with the accumulated affordability gap and lay the foundations for stability going forward.And concludes that if it continues along this path: the department will be able to demonstrate it has really turned a corner.The publication of the equipment plan follows_@REL the Defence_Secretary's_announcement_@DOC last year that the Defence Budget has been balanced for the first time in more than a decade and that the MOD_@ORG is taking a new approach to financial planning.Within the equipment and equipment support budget of around  160 billion over the next ten years, Philip_Hammond_@P1 has introduced for the first time a contingency of  4.8 billion to manage cost variation and protect existing projects.In addition, within the  160 billion,  8 billion is currently unallocated.
This will be allocated as new equipment priorities emerge over the decade and only once the MOD_@ORG is confident that they are affordable and therefore deliverable.Priorities will be decided by the Armed_Forces_Committee_@ORG, chaired_by_@REL the Chief_of_the_Defence_Staff_@P2.Structuring the Defence Equipment Plan and the budget that supports it in this way will enable the MOD_@ORG to deliver Future Force 2020.The equipment plan includes the following major investments in state-of-the-art military capabilities and their support over the next ten years:35.8 billion on submarines and the deterrent, including a total of seven Astute Class attack_submarines_@WEA and developing a replacement for Vanguard Class ballistic_missile_@WEA submarines18.5 billion on combat air, including Lightning_II_@WEA and Typhoon_fast_jets_@WEA and unmanned aerial vehicles;17.4 billion on ships, including Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft_@WEA carriers, six new_Type_45_destroyers_@WEA and the development of the Type_26_Global_Combat_Ship_@WEA;13.9 billion on aircraft_@WEA for air-to-air refuelling, passenger and heavy lift, such as Voyager_@WEA and A400M_@WEA;12.3 billion on armoured_fighting_vehicles_@WEA, including_@REL Warrior, Scout_@WEA and other land_equipment_@WEA;12.1 billion on helicopters_@WEA, including_@REL Chinook, Apache_@WEA, Puma_@WEA and Wildcat_@WEA; and11.4 billion on weapons, for example, missiles, torpedoes_@WEA and precision guided bombs.The_Defence_Equipment_Plan_@DOC gives the defence industry more information than ever before about the MOD_@ORG's priorities to enable them to invest in the capabilities the military will require.Defence Secretary Philip_Hammond_@P1 said:"It is essential that our forces are fully equipped to respond to the range of threats we face in this uncertain world.

Frank Wolf (R-Va. ), chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds the U.S._space_agency_@ORG, that they support his panel's approach tocommercial_crew_vehicle_@WEA development.
"It seems unlikely that NASA_@ORG will receive significant budgetary relief in the foreseeable future," the three retired astronauts wrote in a May 4 letter to Wolf.
"Consequently, it is mandatory to maximize return on the limited funds available to access low Earth orbit.
An early downselect would seem to be prudent in order to maximize the possibility of developing a crew-carrying_spacecraft_@WEA in time to be operationally useful.
"House members are scheduled to debate the Wolf_panel_@ORG's response to NASA_@ORG 's fiscal 2013 budget request on Tuesday.
Report language accompanying the Wolf bill, which was approved by the full_House_Appropriations_Committee_@ORG, calls for "an immediate downselect to a single competitor or, at most, the execution of a leader-follower_paradigm_@DOC in which NASA_@ORG makes one large award to a main commercial partner and a second small award to a backup partner "NASA_@ORG prefers to maintain competition among companies vying for funds under its commercial crew development (CCDev) seed-money effort as long as possible, in the belief that it will ultimately cost less to develop a vehicle that way.
Under pressure from some of the CCDev competitors the agency also opted to continue the program under Space_Act_Agreements_@DOC, rather than using the more restrictive Federal_Acquisition_Regulation_(FAR)_@DOC approach.Wolf 's panel argued that a quick downselect would allow NASA_@ORG to move back to the FAR procurement approach and avoid a complicated transition from funding more than one company under the Space Act to a FAR procurement.
The three Apollo commanders , who earlier_urged_<ORG>Congress_@ORG to resist</REL> White_House_@ORG plans to hand off human access to the private sector, agreed that a Space Act procurement "would be unlikely to provide the documentation that we normally depend upon to provide high confidence in reaching our technical goals.
""We all agree that our country has painted itself into a corner and does not now, nor will for many years, have a U.S. government craft suitable for carrying cargo or crew to the International_Space_Station_@ORG," the astronauts wrote.
"The reputation of our country and the potential liability associated with carrying United States and international crews to and from the ISS dictates that we do everything possible to ensure that any commercial crew service meets standards equal to those that we would enforce would the craft be government owned and operated.

In an age when people and diseases cross borders with growing ease, bioweapons_@WEA are a transnational threat, and therefore we must protect against them with transnational action.The nature of the problem is evolving.
The advances in science and technology make it possible to both prevent and cure more diseases, but also easier for states and non-state actors to develop biological_weapons_@WEA.
A crude, but effective, terrorist_weapon_@WEA can be made by using a small sample of any number of widely available pathogens, inexpensive equipment, and college-level chemistry and biology.
Even as it becomes easier to develop these weapons, it remains extremely difficult - as you know - to detect them, because almost any biological research can serve dual purposes.
The same equipment and technical knowledge used for legitimate research to save lives can also be used to manufacture deadly diseases.So of course, we must continue our work to prevent states from acquiring biological_weapons_@WEA.
And one of the unsung successes of the Convention is that it has engrained a norm among states against biological_weapons_@WEA.
Even countries that have never joined the Convention no longer claim that acquiring such weapons is a legitimate goal.
But unfortunately, the ability of terrorists and other non-state actors to develop and use these weapons is growing.
And therefore, this must be a renewed focus of our efforts during the next 14 days, as well as the months and years ahead.Now, I know there are some in the international community who have_their_doubts_about_the_odds_of_@REL a mass biological attack or major outbreak.
They point out that we have not seen either so far, and conclude the risk must be low.
But that is not the conclusion of the United States, because there are warning signs, and they are too serious to ignore.Terrorist groups have made it known they would want to acquire and use these weapons.
And in the 1990s, the apocalyptic_cult_@ORG, Aum_Shinrikyo_@ORG unleashed two attacks in Tokyo by spraying a liquid containing anthrax spores into the air and unleashing sarin gas into the subway.
In 2001, we found evidence in Afghanistan that al-Qaida_@ORG was_seeking_the_ability_to_conduct_@REL bioweapons_@WEA attacks.
And less than a year ago, al-Qaida_@ORG in the Arabian Peninsula made a call to arms for - and I quote - "brothers with degrees in microbiology or chemistry to develop a weapon_of_mass_destruction_@WEA.
"We all have an interest in ramping up our efforts to prevent outbreaks and attacks and then to be prepared to respond if they do occur.
The 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States killed five people and sickened 17.
More than 10,000 were required to go on to antibiotics.
A mass outbreak could cripple an already fragile global economy by cutting off the movement of people, goods, and sparking food shortages.
And of course, a victim of an attack could just as easily travel from one country to another.So shoring up our domestic and international defenses will make it easier to detect and respond.
We need public health systems that can quickly diagnose outbreaks, whatever their source, and mobilize the right medical resources and personnel.
By making any one country more secure, we make the international community more secure at the same time.Two years ago, the Obama_Administration_@ORG released_@REL our national strategy for countering biological threats, which is a whole-of-government approach designed to protect the American people and improve our global capacity.
We support our partners' efforts to meet new international standards in disease preparedness, detection, and response.
We are helping make laboratories safer and more secure, engaging 44 countries in these efforts this year.
And since 2007, we've conducted more than a dozen workshops to help train public health and law enforcement officials.But there is still more to do, and I want to briefly mention three areas.
First, we need to bolster international confidence that all countries are living up to our obligations under the Convention.
It is not possible, in our opinion, to create a verification regime that will achieve this goal.
But we must take other steps.
To begin with, we should revise the Convention's annual reporting systems to ensure that each party is answering the right questions, such as what we are each all doing to guard against the misuse of biological materials.Countries should also take their own measures to demonstrate transparency.
Under our new Bio-Transparency_and_Openness_Initiative_@DOC, we will host an international forum on health and security to exchange views on biological threats and discuss the evolution of U.S._bioresearch_programs_@PROG.
We will underscore that commitment by inviting a few state parties to the Convention to tour a U.S._biodefense_facility_@WEA next year, as Ambassador_van_den_IJssel_@P1 and the UN_1540_Committee_@ORG did this past summer.
And we will promote dialogue through exchanges among scientists from the United States and elsewhere.
In short, we are intending and our meeting our obligation to the full letter and spirit of the treaty, and we wish to work with other nations to do so as well.Second, we must strengthen each country's ability to detect and respond to outbreaks and improve international coordination.
As President_Obama_@P1 said_earlier_this_year_at_@REL the UN, "We must come together to prevent and detect and fight every kind of biological danger, whether it's a pandemic like H1N1, or a terrorist threat, or a terrible disease. "
Five years ago, 194 countries came together at the World_Health_Organization_@ORG and committed to build our core capacities by June 2012, and we should redouble our efforts to meet that goal.
We will support the WHO_@ORG in this area, and I urge others to join us.Finally, we need thoughtful international dialogue about the ways to maximize the benefits of scientific research and minimize the risks.
For example, the emerging gene synthesis industry is_making_@REL genetic_material_@WEA widely available.
This obviously has many benefits for research, but it could also potentially be used to assemble the components of a deadly organism.
So how do we balance the need for scientific freedom and innovation with the necessity of guarding against such risksThere is no easy answer, but it begins with open conversations among governments, the scientific community, and other stakeholders, in this forum and elsewhere.
We have recently had our U.S. President's Commission on Bioethics develop ethical principles that could be helpful in this dialogue, and we urge a discussion about them.
Ambassador_Kennedy_@P1 and the U.S. team look forward to working with all of you for a strong set of recommendations.And let me conclude by saying we know the biological threats we face today are new, but our commitment to face threats together is not.
More than 85 years ago, after the horrors of World War I, the international community took a stand against the use of poison_gases_@WEA and bacteriological_weapons_@WEA.
And nearly a half-century later, that shared commitment brought us together to adopt the Biological_Weapons_Convention_@PROG.
So in that same spirit, let us move forward to address the challenges we face together in the 21 st century.Thank you very much.PRN: 2011/T57-19docno: 126678New waterjets could propel LCS_@WEA to greater speeds14:53, Technology/EngineeringFull size imageThe Navy_@ORG's fifth Littoral Combat Ship (LCS_@WEA), Milwaukee_@WEA, will be the first to benefit from new high-power density waterjets aimed at staving off rudder and propeller damage experienced on high-speed ships.The product of an Office_of_Naval_Research_(ONR)_@ORG Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) program, the waterjets arrived last month at the Marinette_Marine_shipyard_@ORG in Wisconsin, where Milwaukee_@WEA (LCS_@WEA 5) is under construction.
"We believe these waterjets are the future," said Dr._Ki-Han_Kim_@P1, program_manager_@REL in ONR's_Ship_Systems_and_Engineering_Research_Division_@ORG.
"Anything that we can do to keep ships ready to go will ultimately benefit our warfighters.
"Chief_of_Naval_Operations_Adm._Jonathan_Greenert_@P1's_@REL 2013-2017 Navigation Plan calls for fielding improved ships to support counterterrorism and irregular warfare missions at sea and ashore.
The LCS_@WEA will play a big role in the Navy_@ORG's plan as a modular, adaptable vessel for use against diesel_submarines_@WEA, littoral_mines_@WEA and attacks by small surface craft.Developed by Rolls-Royce_Naval_Marine_@ORG in Walpole, Mass., in_collaboration_with_@REL ONR and Naval_Surface_Warfare_Center_@ORG, Carderock_Division_@ORG, the new Axial-Flow_Waterjet_Mk-1_@WEA can move nearly half a million gallons of seawater per minute, providing more thrust per unit than current commercial waterjets.
Four of the new waterjets will propel the LCS_@WEA to speeds greater than 40 knots.Researchers believe the smaller, more efficient waterjets will help the LCS_@WEA avoid excessive maintenance costs associated with cavitationa  a phenomenon that occurs when changes in pressure create air bubbles on rotating machinery, such as marine propellers.
Repeated occurrences can cause whole chunks of metal to wear away, leading to frequent repairs and replacements.The waterjets' new design could increase their lifespan between repairs.The FNC_program_@PROG that oversaw_development_of_this_technology_proved_to_be_as_adaptable_as_@REL LCS_@WEA.
The waterjets originally were slated to benefit another ship program that was discontinued.
Instead of cancelling the waterjets program, officials regrouped and shifted their focus to designing a product that would improve the performance of LCS_@WEA.ONR's FNC_program_@PROG saves taxpayer money by streamlining processes to deliver cutting-edge products within five years.
The waterjets project began in 2007, and the delivery last month to the shipyard marked its successful completion.Next up for the waterjets will be full-scale sea trials on Milwaukee_@WEA (LCS_@WEA 5), expected to occur in the next 24 months.Eventually, the waterjets could end up on 10 LCS_@WEA under contract to be built by Lockheed_@ORG Martin.Provided by Office_of_Naval_Researchdocno_@ORG: 12686Space, Nuclear_Weapons_@WEA, and Ballistic_Missile_Defense_@PROG - The New TriadMay 8, 2012 ::  The Heritage Foundation  ::In April, the Independent_Working_Group_(IWG)_@ORG on Missile Defense and the Space Relationship held_an_event_on_@REL the new triad-space, nuclear_weapons_@WEA, and ballistic_missile_@WEA defense-and its importance for the United States.
It explored the fundamental importance and the relationship among the different elements of defense.
The United States currently does not have a strategy that would integrate these elements in a synergistic manner.Robert Butterworth, president_of_Aries_Analytics_@P2, pointed out that the intelligence community developed_@REL the military space systems the United States operates today.
That community, however, has fundamentally different interests than the military.
The United States needs to better articulate and determine what U.S. future military capabilities will be and what space systems would best address their requirements.
U.S. nuclear_policy_@DOC suffers from a similar lack of coherent vision, which makes the recent push for yet another round of nuclear reductions questionable.
The current guidance is full of contradictions: The U.S. has a plan for new delivery_vehicles_@WEA, but it must_use_@REL old nuclear warheads_@WEA and cannot test them.Keith Payne, president_@REL of the National Institute for Public Policy and former_Deputy_Assistant_Secretary_@REL of Defense for Forces Policy, noted that according to the Nuclear Posture Review, President_Obama_@P1's top goal is nonproliferation.
The Administration assumes that missile defenses work against this goal by discouraging future reductions (note Russia's recent threats of a preemptive strike if the U.S. deploys its missile defenses to Europe).
This leads to an irreconcilable tension between a drive to "nuclear zero"-a world without nuclear_weapons_@WEA-and missile defense, plus the need to sustain nuclear forces.
In addition, with fewer nuclear_weapons_@WEA, the Administration would be required to move toward counter-value targets (training missiles at an adversary's populations).
This approach, rejected for more than five decades, has been considered immoral and illegal.
Resilience and adaptability, necessary to adapt to future threats and assure allies, are lost when the U.S. has a lower nuclear capability.Ambassador Henry Cooper, former_director_@REL of the Strategic_Defense_Initiative_Organization_@ORG, emphasized that the United States will not move to the most effective and cost-efficient interceptors in space without strong presidential leadership.
Such leadership is lacking in the Obama_Administration_@ORG.
While the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is gone, limits on the missile_defense_program_@PROG remain.
For example, so far the successive Administrations since the withdrawal from the treaty have not taken steps to make Aegis capable of countering short-range as well as intermediate-range ballistic_missile_@WEAs.
In addition, the Aegis program can_be_accelerated_to_give_it_the_ability_to_@REL counter long-range_missile_@WEAs, including_@REL intercontinental ballistic_missile_@WEAs.Rob Soofer, the_<P2>Strategic_Forces_Policy_Advisor_@P2</REL> for Senator_Jon_Kyl_@P1 (R-AZ), provided a congressional perspective by mentioning three issues that are a priority for the GOP leadership.
First, the Administration's commitment to the nuclear_weapons_@WEA complex is fading, as the President's defense budget request this year is below what the Administration agreed to provide in concurrence with the New_Strategic_Arms_Reduction_Treaty_(New_START)_@DOC.
A loss of scientists without nuclear_weapons_@WEA design experience is equally concerning.
Second, reductions below the New START level will not be possible unless the Administration provides funding for nuclear modernization.
Third, while the Administration emphasized regional missile defense, Republicans in Congress_@ORG would like to see more resources invested in homeland defense.

16, 2014 - 02:51PM   |By DAVID_PUGLIESE_@P1   |A leaked US document has put the Canadian government under fire over the proposed F-35_@WEA purchase.
(Lockheed_@ORG Martin)Filed UnderWorld_NewsNorth_AmericaVICTORIA_@ORG, BRITISH COLUMBIA - A leaked US document has raised new questions about Canada's involvement in the F-35_@WEA program and given critics of the fighter jet as well as opposition members of Parliament_@ORG new ammunition to accuse the Canadian government of misleading the public about the proposed acquisition.An Oct. 27 briefing by US_Air_Force_Lt._Gen._Chris_Bogdan_@P1, F-35_@WEA Program Executive Office director, outlined how Canada intends to initially purchase four F-35_@WEAs.
That flies in the face of continued Canadian government assurances that no decision had been made about whether the country would buy the aircraft_@WEA.Defense News has seen a copy of the document.Canada's Conservative_Party_government_@ORG originally_committed_in_2010_to_purchasing_@REL 65 F-35_@WEAs, but the acquisition soon became a major political albatross around the neck of Prime Minister Stephen Harper.Opposition Parliament_@ORG members alleged_his_government_misled_Canadians_about_@REL the F-35_@WEA's price and performance.In April 2012, Auditor_General_Michael_Ferguson_@P1 found that Department_of_National_Defence_officials_@P2 withheld_key_information_from_@REL Parliament_@ORG about the jet, underesti-mated costs and didn't follow proper procurement rules.The government, under continuing fire about the increasing cost of the F-35_@WEAs, announced in December 2012 it would put the procurement on a temporary hold and examine other aircraft_@WEA.
That process is ongoing, government_ministers_@P2 said.But Bogdan's briefing_to_@REL US Air Force Secretary_@REL Deborah Lee James undercuts those claims.
Bogdan pointed_out_that_Canada_wants_to_"swap"_@REL four aircraft_@WEA destined_for_@REL the US Air Force and receive those as early as 2015.The aircraft_@WEA would be replaced at a later date by Canada.Bogdan_@P1 noted in the 14-page briefing deck that the US Air Force agrees with the plan as long as the F-35_@WEA initial operating capability date of 2016 remains on schedule and no other allies make similar requests.For the swap to happen, Canada needs to deliver a letter of intent to the F-35_@WEA project engineering office this month, the briefing points out.
Congress_@ORG would also have to be notified.Kyra Hawn, spokeswoman_@REL for the F-35_@WEA Joint Program Office, said the "briefing was for official use only.
It was to inform future decisions regarding Canada's F-35_@WEA acquisition.
We will not be commenting any further on the content of the slides.
"Lockheed_@ORG Martin spokesman_@REL Mike Barton referred_questions_to_@REL Canada's_Public_Works_Department_@ORG "as these would be government-to-government type discussions and nothing we would be privy to.
"Marcel Poulin, press_secretary_@REL for Public Works Minister Diane Finley, said, "No decision has been made on the replacement of Canada's CF-18_fleet_@WEA.
"He did not explain why Bogdan was_informing_@REL James about Canada's decision to proceed with the F-35_@WEA if the Canadian government still_had_not_made_a_decision_on_purchasing_@REL the aircraft_@WEA.But analysts and opposition MPs are_pointing_to_@REL Bogdan's briefing as a smoking gun that proves the Conservative_Party_government_@ORG has_been_misleading_@REL Parliament_@ORG and the Canadian public.
"Getting into the production line this fiscal year is clearly an intention to go ahead and buy those planes," said Jack_Harris_@P1, defense_critic_@REL with the official opposition New Democratic_Party.He_@ORG noted that the Bogdan briefing proves the Canadian government is "going behind the backs of Canadians" and that it plans to move ahead with the acquisition despite continuing concerns about the F-35_@WEA and its costs.
"[The public is] just being deceived by this government taking action without the kind of transparency that's required, without the proper debate, without notifying Canadians, without notifying Parliament_@ORG," Harris added.Alan Williams_@P1, the_<P2>former_Canadian_defense_procurement_chief_@P2</REL>, said the information contained in Bogdan's briefing raises questions about the government's claims it is examining other aircraft_@WEA besides_the_<WEA>F-35_@WEA to replace</REL> the CF-18s_@WEA.
"The government claims about a fair and transparent process are called into question," Williams_@P1 said.Some Canadian <ORG>aerospace_industry_@ORG representatives and political analysts</REL>, such as Michael_Byers_of_the_University_of_British_Columbia_@P1, see the move as designed to quickly lock the country into an F-35_@WEA purchase before any competition could be considered.Industry representatives said the move was clumsy, destined to fail and will only provide further ammunition for F-35_@WEA critics.Canada is still an official partner in the F-35_@WEA program and has not informed the US_government_@ORG or Lockheed_@ORG Martin of any plans to change that.
Canada operates 78 CF-18 fighter aircraft_@WEA.
It was originally planning to replace those with the conventional take-off and landing version of the F-35_@WEA.In the meantime, the Canadian government has ordered a modernization program for the CF-18s_@WEA to keep them flying until 2025.Johanna_Quinney_@P1, spokeswoman_@REL for Defence_Minister_Rob_Nicholson_@P1, said the modernization project is expected to start in 2016 and be completed in 2019.The program will include replacement of some flight controls, as well as structural and avionics upgrades.
Core_CF-18_avionics_systems_@WEA will also need to be augmented to provide secure communi-cations between the CF-18 and allied units, Quinney said.
The aircraft_@WEA's software will also be modernized and simulators will be upgraded.All content   2014, Gannett Government Media Corporationdocno: 428460November 18, 2014New Orleans Becomes Home to Fastest Internet Hub in the WorldNEW ORLEANS, La.

"By building the fastest, most innovative operational network possible every year, SCinet_@ORG gives the SC_conference_attendees_@P3 a unique chance to showcase and discover_the_latest_research_in_@REL HPC_@TECH," says Kate_Petersen_Mace_@P1, Director_of_External_Partnership_Management_@REL at Clemson University and SC14's SCinet_@ORG Chair.
"SCinet_@ORG enables data-intensive research and live_use_of_@REL high performing hardware to run_@REL multi-gigabit demonstrations, requiring a fast and robust infrastructure.
We start planning for SCinet_@ORG well over a year in advance of the conference, with input from the HPC_@TECH community.

I'm very excited to see how our attendees make use of our SC14 resources.
"SCinet_@ORG is built by a team of expert volunteers_@P3 from around the world, taking one year to design the network, three weeks to set it up, four days to operate it, and twenty-four hours to tear it down.
Over 100 engineers from industry, academia and government institutions came together to build this network, using_@REL over $18 million in loaned equipment and over 80 miles of newly installed fiber optic cable lines in the convention center.This year, SCinet_@ORG has_connected_@REL multiple circuits, resulting_in_@REL an unprecedented bandwidth of 1.3 terabits per second, in collaboration with leading national and international research networks and commodity providers.

"For better or worse, the process of decommissioning of nuclear_facilities_@WEA from service is happening for the first time in Bulgaria.
I will not hide the fact that it was not easy to meet NRA_@ORG's requirements for this activity," Petrov_@P1 said.Difficulties in preparing for the licences included structural changes at SE_RAW_Kozloduy_@ORG in order to meet the requirements of the European_Bank_for_Reconstruction_and_Development_(EBRD)_@ORG, which finances the salaries of the Bulgarian company's employees, he added.During European_Union_@ORGaccession_negotiations_with_@REL the European_Commission_@ORG, Bulgaria committed to closing units 1 and 2 of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant by the end of 2002 and units 3 and 4 by the end of 2006.
All four units are V-230_model_VVER-440_reactors_@WEA, which the EC had_earlier_classified_as_non-upgradable_@REL.
However, units 3 and 4 were of an improved design and closer to the later V-213_@WEA design than any others of their class.In addition to the national decommissioning fund, in June 2001 the Kozloduy_International_Decommissioning_Support_Fund_@ORGwas_established_at_@REL the EBRD to finance_decommissioning_activities_of_@REL Kozloduy_1-4_@WEA as well as to support energy projects in the country.NRA_@ORG transferred the licences for units 1 and 2 to in October 2010, in anticipation of decommissioning work.Westinghouse_@ORG said in August it plans to hold a competitive tender "within the next year" for construction of a seventh reactor at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant.
The AP1000_reactor_@WEA is projected to be online by 2023.
The site is already home to two operating Russian-designed VVER-1000_@WEA pressurised_@REL water_reactors_@WEA, Kozloduy_5_and_6_@WEA, as well as the four shut-down VVER-440s_@WEA.Westinghouse_@ORG, part_of_Japan's_@REL Toshiba_group_@ORG, announced the target date following its signing_of_@REL a shareholder agreement for the Kozloduy_nuclear_power_plant_expansion_project_@PROG.

Approximately 92 percent of the nation's shipping containers move through the four shipping hubs.
Work on the effort began in 2007 and management of the technology was formally handed over to Mexican author_@P2ities on Tuesday.
"The inauguration of the Megaports in these four cities is an illustration of Mexico's overall commitment to modernize its import and export management system over recent years, and to address its responsibilities under United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1540_@DOC, which calls on member states to take specific actions to prevent the proliferation of controlled materials and equipment and prevent non-state actors from acquiring weapons of mass destruction," according to U.S._Embassy_@ORG Deputy Chief of Mission Laura Dogu.The successful institution of the anti-nuclear trafficking effort "is also an illustration of the continuing close cooperation between the United States and Mexico to make our shared landmass safer and more secure for the citizens of both countries," Dogu stated (EFE/ Fox News , July 25).TagsCounterproliferation, Nuclear ,Nuclear Smuggling and Materials TraffickingRelated GSN StoriesMultinational Counterproliferation Drill to be Held in JapanTurkey Confiscates Potential Radiological "Dirty Bomb" SubstanceCIA Opens_@REL Counterproliferation CenterSouth Korea to Conduct Anti-WMD_ExercisesColombia_@WEA Joins Proliferation Security Initiativedocno: 438675 Missile_ThreatA_Project_@PROG of the George C.

High-Energy_Innovation_@DOC is the second of three reports in the Climate_Pragmatism_project_@DOC, a partnership of Arizona_State_University's_Consortium_for_Science,_Policy,_and_Outcomes_@ORG and The Breakthrough Institute.High-Energy_Innovation_@DOC evaluates_@REL four clean_energy_technologies_@TECH - shale gas, carbon_capture_and_storage_@TECH, nuclear, and solar_@TECH - and finds that, in all cases, industrializing countries are making significant investments and leveraging international collaborations in order to make energy cleaner, cheaper and more reliable.Nearly all of the growth in energy markets and the majority of new_energy_technologies_@TECH deployed in the next several decades are projected to occur in the developing world.
"It is [in non-OECD countries] that we should expect to see - and should work hardest to accelerate - energy innovation," write the author_@P2s.
Among the report's author_@P2s are Gary Dirks, director_@REL of ASU's Global Institute of Sustainability, and consortium_co-director_@REL Daniel Sarewitz.Through a series of detailed maps, High-Energy_Innovation_@DOC charts_@REL energy_innovation_in_shale_gas_@TECH, carbon_capture_and_storage_@TECH, nuclear, and solar_@TECH currently underway worldwide.
By leveraging high-growth markets in support of advancing important clean_energy_technologies_@TECH, the report argues that this globalized "high-energy innovation" offers the most pragmatic path toward modernity in emerging economies and the best chance to develop and scale cheap, clean, abundant energy in all nations.More information: The report is available online: http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/issues/innovation-policy/high-energy-innovationProvided by Arizona State University--------------------------------------------------------------------------------docno: 439856 The Department of the Navy_@ORG's_@REL Information Technology MagazineNavy_@ORG Moving Forward With LCS_@WEABy Office of the Secretary of the Navy_@ORG - December 11, 2014WASHINGTON (NNS_@ORG) -- Secretary_of_Defense_Chuck_Hagel_@P1 has_directed_@REL the Navy_@ORG "to move forward with a multi-mission_small_surface_combatant_@WEA based_on_modified_@REL Littoral Combat Ship (LCS_@WEA) hull designs.
"Consistent with the Fleet's views on the most valued capabilities delivered by a small surface combatant, the modified LCS_@WEA ship will be more lethal and survivable.
It will provide multi-mission anti-surface warfare (SUW) and anti-submarine warfare capabilities (ASW), as well as continuous and effective air,_surface_and_underwater_self-defense_@TECH.
Adding to current LCS_@WEA Flight 0+ baseline configurations, which include_@REL the 57mm_gun_@WEA and SeaRAM_missile_system_@WEA, this ship will be equipped with over-the-horizon_surface-to-surface_missiles_@WEA, air_defense_upgrades_@TECH (sensors_@WEA and weapons), an advanced_electronic_warfare_system_@WEA; advanced decoys; a towed_array_system_for_submarine_detection_and_torpedo_defense_@WEA, two 25mm_guns_@WEA, an armed_helicopter_@WEA capable of engaging with either Hellfire_missiles_@WEA or MK-54 torpedoes_@WEA, and an unmanned FireScout_@WEA helicopter for surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting.Modularity design features will also be retained to augment SUW and ASW capabilities as directed_by_@REL the Fleet_Commanders_@P2.
Available mission modules include Longbow_Surface_to-Surface_Missiles_@WEA (Hellfire), two MK46_30mm_guns_@WEA, and two 11M_RHIBs_@WEA for Surface Warfare, or a variable_depth_sonar_@WEA for submarine warfare which, when added to the ship's organic multi-function towed array and embarked helicopter, make this an extremely effective anti-submarine_warfare_platform.In_@WEA addition to the improved weapon_systems_@WEA capabilities for this ship, which reduce its susceptibility to being hit by a threat_weapon_@WEA, the small surface combatant will also include improved passive measures - measures that will reduce the ship's signature against mine threats, and measures that will harden certain vital spaces and systems against potential damage caused by weapon impact - to further enhance its overall survivability.From an operational perspective, the sum of these improvements will increase the ship's capability and availability to participate in SUW_Surface_Action_Groups_@ORG, ASW_Search_and_Attack_Units_@ORG; escort of High_Value_Units_@ORG, and support of Carrier_Strike_Group_(CSG)_@ORG SUW and ASW operations.With increased lethality and survivability, the modified LCS_@WEA will provide the flexibility to operate both independently and as a part of an aggregated force.
This decision allows the Navy_@ORG to add_organic_multi-mission_capabilities_to_@REL the small surface combatant force while leveraging_the_benefits_and_affordability_of_@REL the LCS_@WEA program.
The modified LCS_@WEA ships will_complement_the_planned_32_@REL LCS_@WEA ships, resulting in a 52 ship_Small_Surface_Combatant_Fleet_@WEA in_keeping_with_@REL the Navy_@ORG's Force Structure Analysis.
The 32 LCS_@WEA ships, with their full modular capability, will allow the Navy_@ORG to deploy assets to meet the Navy_@ORG's mine warfare, SUW, and ASW demands.For more Navy_@ORG news go to: Navy_@ORG News Service .TAGS: Cybersecurity_@TECH , Spectrum , Telecommunications , Wireless , WorkforceSANTA RITA, Guam (Dec. 11, 2014) The littoral combat ship USS Fort Worth (LCS_@WEA 3) is moored at Apra Harbor on U.S.

The automated process will be used to make canopies-the transparent shells around the cockpits-for_@WEA more than 2,000 aircraft_@WEA, saving as much as $125 million over the life of the F-35_@WEA program.ONR ManTech led_a_team_of_@REL military and industry scientists and engineers in automating the thermoforming process used to create F-35_@WEA canopies, saving time and money and eliminating potential hazards for human work crews.
"This award confirms our commitment to developing the most efficient and cost-effective ways to manufacture some of the most critical hardware our Sailors and Marines use," said John_Carney_@P1, director_of_ONR_@P2's_@REL ManTech_program.The_automation_project_@PROG began in 2011 and cost just $1.3 million.
Much of the work was carried out at the Composites_Manufacturing_Technology_Center_@ORG , one of seven centers of excellence under ONR's_@REL ManTech program.
"The potential cost savings represent a huge return on a relatively small initial investment by ONR," said Neil_Graf_@P1, Program_Officer_@REL for ONR ManTech.The F-35_@WEA canopy represents_the_cutting_edge_in_@REL aircraft_@WEA design.
Its unique shape and specialized material the make the canopy manufacturing process more complex than that for other aircraft_@WEA.Currently, skilled technicians load an acrylic shell into a forming tool and load the assembly into an oven heated to 200 degrees where the canopy forms over a span of up to six days.
During that time, workers regularly enter the oven to makes observations and manually adjust positioning clamps to control the forming process.The new method uses a control_system_with_cameras_@WEA to see inside the oven to calculate the rate at which the canopy's shape is forming.
The clamps automatically adjust to ensure the shape remains uniform throughout the process to meet the F-35_@WEA's stringent requirements.The new system gets the job done in just two or three days.
It also requires fewer tools and oven time and less clean-up afterwards.
Most importantly, workers no longer have to enter the hot ovens.The automated thermoforming process underscores the Chief_of_Naval_Operations'_Navigation_Plan_@P2 that calls for the service to continue efforts to make investments to address near-term challenges and develop future capabilities even in the face of budget constraints.ONR ManTech partnered_with_experts_from_@REL the F-35_@WEA Program Office, Naval_Air_Systems_Command_@ORG, GKN_Aerospace_Transparency_Systems_@ORG and Penn_State's_Applied_Research_Laboratory_@ORG to develop_@REL the automated system.GKN_Aerospace_Transparency_Systems_@ORG, in_coordination_with_@REL the F-35_@WEA Program Office, plans to implement the new process in May 2015.Eric_Beidel_@P1 is a contractor_@REL in ONR's_Corporate_Strategic_Communications_@ORG department.About the Office of Naval ResearchThe Department of the Navy_@ORG's_@REL Office_of_Naval_Research_(ONR)_@ORG provides_the_science_and_technology_necessary_to_maintain_@REL the Navy_@ORG and Marine_Corps_@ORG' technological advantage.

"
The most important being the 1987_Intermediate-range_Nuclear_Forces_Treaty_@DOC, which the U.S. accuses Russia of violating by flight testing a new cruise missile.--"Despite the dispute, it would be a huge mistake for the United States to withdraw from the I.N.F._treaty_@DOC, as some congressmen have demanded.
That would remove all restraints on Russia and seriously weaken a system of treaties that has been remarkably effective over decades at curbing the spread of destructive_weapons_@WEA.
It would also be a mistake for either side to reintroduce the banned_weapons_@WEA onto their own territory or elsewhere. "
--"The United States and its allies should make efforts to bring Russia back into compliance with the treaty, and Russia needs to know that defiance will come at a cost. "

CorkerUS-Russia Relationsdocno: 449895News | January 8, 2015Improved Saturn Positions Help Spacecraft Navigation, Planet Studies, Fundamental PhysicsScientists have used the National_Science_Foundation_@ORG's_@REL Very_Long_Baseline_Array_(VLBA)_radio-telescope_system_@WEA and NASA_@ORG's_@REL Cassini_spacecraft_@WEA to measure the position of Saturn and its family of moons to within about a mile -- at a range of nearly a billion miles.
This feat improves astronomers' knowledge of the dynamics of our Solar System and also benefits interplanetary_spacecraft_navigation_@TECH and research on fundamental physics.The researchers_@P3, from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRA_@ORGO) and NASA_@ORG's_@REL Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory_(JPL)_@ORG, used the continent-wide_VLBA_@WEA to pinpoint_the_position_of_@REL Cassini as it orbited_Saturn_over_the_past_decade_by_receiving_the_signal_from_@REL the spacecraft's radio_transmitter_@WEA.
Combined with information about Cassini's orbit from NASA_@ORG's Deep_Space_Network_@TECH, the VLBA observations allowed the scientists to make the most accurate determinations yet of the position of the center of mass, called the barycenter, of Saturn and its numerous moons.The scientists presented the results of their work at the American_Astronomical_Society_@ORG's meeting in Seattle, Washington.The measurement, some 50-100 times more precise than those provided by ground-based_optical_telescopes_@WEA, was possible because of the VLBA's great resolving power, or ability to discern fine detail.
With its 10 dish antennas spread from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands, the VLBA operates_as_@REL a single radio_telescope_@WEA with a virtual size nearly equal to the Earth's diameter.The result is a greatly improved ephemeris -- a table of predicted positions -- for the Saturnian system.
"An accurate ephemeris is one of the basic tools of astronomy, and this work is a great step toward tying together our understanding of the orbits of the outer planets and those of the inner planets," said Dayton_Jones_@P1, of JPL, in Pasadena, California.
"The orbits of the inner planets are well tied together, but those of the outer planets, including Saturn, have not been tied as well to each other or to those of the inner planets," Jones said.The improved positional information will directly benefit scientists' ability to precisely navigate interplanetary spacecraft.
In addition, it will help refine measurements of the masses of other Solar System objects.
Also, the positional precision will improve predictions of when Saturn or its rings will pass in front of background stars, events that provide a variety of research opportunities.Other benefits will come to studies of several aspects of fundamental physics.
The new positional information will help researchers_@P3 improve their precision when timing the radio pulses from pulsars -- spinning superdense neutron stars.
Such timing will help answer unsolved questions about particle physics and the exact nature of the highly-compressed material inside a neutron star.
Ongoing projects that time the pulses from multiple pulsars spread across our Milky Way Galaxy in an attempt to detect the effects of passing gravitational waves also will benefit from the improved Saturn ephemeris, which also improves the overall Solar System ephemeris.VLBA measurements_of_the_position_of_@REL Cassini have even helped scientists who seek to make ever-more-stringent tests of Albert_Einstein_@P1's_@REL theory_of_General_Relativity_@DOC by observing small changes in the apparent positions of strongly-emitting quasars as Saturn passes near them on the sky.The position the scientists determined is that of the barycenter -- the center of mass -- of Saturn and its moons.
When two bodies are in orbit, they both rotate about the barycenter.
For example, the barycenter of the Sun and Jupiter is just outside the surface of the Sun, and the barycenter of the Earth and our Moon is about 1700 kilometers beneath the Earth's surface.
The barycenter of Saturn and its largest moon, Titan, is about 30 kilometers from the center of Saturn.
The barycenter of Saturn and all its moons (some 62 at current count) is what follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun.In other studies, the VLBA has_been_used_to_measure_the_positions_of_@REL Mars-orbiting_satellites_@WEA, and Voyager_@WEA 1, the most distant man-made object, now some 12 billion miles (19 billion kilometers) from Earth on a journey that began with its launch in 1977.In 2016, NASA_@ORG's_@REL Juno_spacecraft_@WEA will begin orbiting Jupiter.
"We plan to use similar techniques on this spacecraft, and improve the orbit for Jupiter as well," Jones said.Jones worked_with_@REL William_Folkner_@P1, Robert_Jacobson_@P1, and Christopher_Jacobs_@P1, all of JPL, and Jon_Romney_@P1, Vivek_Dhawan_@P1, and Edward_Fomalont_@P1, of the NRA_@ORGO.The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is_a_facility_of_@REL the National_Science_Foundation_@ORG, operated_under_cooperative_agreement_by_@REL Associated Universities, Inc.

Privacy Statement .docno: 452969 Missile_ThreatA_Project_@PROG of the George C. Marshall and Claremont InstitutesHaney: Strategic Deterrence More Than a Nuclear TriadDoD NewsOriginally published athttp://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp story_id=85225Posted on January 16, 2015 by editorWASHINGTON (NNS_@ORG) - The United States' strategic deterrent includes a triad of nuclear_delivery_platforms_@WEA, but other critical elements range from intelligence and missile defense to space and cyber capabilities and a capable workforce, Navy_@ORG Adm._Cecil_Haney_@P1 said here today.The commander_of_U.S._Strategic_Command_@P2 spoke on strategic deterrence in the 21st century during a discussion moderated by Thom_Shanker_of_the_New_York_Times_@P1 and hosted by the Atlantic_Council_@ORG's_@REL Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security.The strategic deterrent includes a robust and agile intelligence apparatus, a synthesis of dedicated space and ground sensors_@WEA that provide_critical_early_warning_for_@REL missile_launchers_@WEA and bomber_@WEA threats, national nuclear command and control and the necessary infrastructure to sustain nuclear_weapons_@WEA without fully testing the warheads_@WEA, the admiral said.Other parts of the deterrent are a credible missile defense system that defends against limited attacks from rogue nations, cyberspace_@TECH and space capabilities, trained and ready people, a campaign plan that orients assigned capabilities and activities toward a common purpose, and synchronized treaties, policies and strategies, Haney added.A Whole-of-Government Approach"This is not just capability but a whole-of-government approach that requires our attention and the necessary resources," Haney said, adding that the Nuclear_Deterrent_Enterprise_Review_Group_@ORG recently_established_by_@REL Defense_Secretary_@REL Chuck Hagel provides important support for the nation's deterrent.Even in an era of significant resource constraints the nation must get 21st century deterrence right, Haney said, and must make clear to adversaries or potential adversaries that restraint is always the better course.
"It will require us to work together as a team, as partners - the government, the private sector and academia," he said, "to shape policy that will have a meaningful impact on our national security.
"Haney recalled_@REL President_Barack_Obama_@P1's_@REL2009_Prague_speech_@DOC, in which Obama publicly_stated_his_goal_for_a_world_free_of_@REL nuclear_weapons_@WEA, and said the new START_treaty_@DOC between the United States and Russia - formally called Measures_for_the_Further_Reduction_and_Limitation_of_Strategic_Offensive_Arms_@DOC - is an effort to work toward that goal.Deterrents Can Fail"The president's 2013 Nuclear_Weapons_@WEA Employment Strategy and strategic documents such as the 2010_Nuclear_Posture_Review_@DOC and the 2014_Quadrennial_Defense_Review_@DOC make it clear that as long as nuclear_weapons_@WEA exist," Haney said, "the United States must maintain a strong and credible safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent and   be prepared for the possibility that deterrents can fail.
"Of the multiple states around the globe who have nuclear_weapons_@WEA or aspirations of acquiring them, the admiral mentioned Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.Russia has had more than a decade of investments and modernization across its strategic nuclear forces, he said, adding that the U.S. approach to dealing with Russia in this context today is not about continuing the Cold War.
"This is about emerging capability at a time of significant concerns about Russians' execution of their near and abroad strategy," Haney said, adding that Russia has significant cyber capability.A Time of Significant ConcernsRussia also has significant cyber capability and Russian leaders have publicly stated that they are developing counter-space capabilities and that Russia's_armed_forces_@ORG have anti-satellite_weapon_@WEAs and conduct anti-satellite research.China also is modernizing its strategic forces, the admiral said, by enhancing silo-based intercontinental ballistic_missile_@WEAs, conducting the first fleet tests of a new mobile_missile_@WEA and making progress on a successor expected to be another road-mobile_ICBM_@WEAcapable_of_carrying_@REL multiple warheads_@WEA.
China is also testing and integrating new ballistic_missile_@WEA submarines, providing that nation with its first sea-based strategic nuclear deterrent, Haney said.
"As I'm sure you're aware," he told the audience, "they're also developing multidimensional space capabilities supporting their access-denial campaign.
But with more than 60 nations operating_satellites_@WEA in space, it's extremely problematic to see China conducting missiles designed_to_destroy_@REL satellites.
"North Korea continues to advance its nuclear ambitions, the admiral added, and Iran has made no secret of its desire to acquire nuclear_weapons_@WEA.21st_Century_DeterrentsHaney_@P1 said, "21st century deterrents must be tailored to specific adversaries and threats, and in an integrated manner, so we can predict what deters and what prevents escalation.
"Haney's top priority is to deter strategic attack and provide the nation with a safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent force, but he's also interested in international partnerships and promoting innovation for future capabilities.In the past year he's had meetings with defense ministers of South Korea, France and Australia, a former_Japanese_defense_minister_@P2, the United_Kingdom's_vice_defense_chief_@P2, and five partners involved in space-sharing agreements.In October, he said, "we conducted a command-and-control exercise designed to train our Defense_Department_@ORG forces and access our joint operational readiness across all my mission areas with a specific focus on nuclear readiness.
"Accessing Joint Operational ReadinessStratcom did_this_in_conjunction_with_@REL U.S._Northern_Command_@ORG, the North_American_Aerospace_Defense_Command_@ORG, and Canadian partners in exercises that included Vigilant Shield, Positive Response and Determined Dragon.Another of Haney's high priorities is bolstering Stratcom's ability to anticipate change and confront uncertainty with agility and innovation.
"Last summer we cut the ribbon at U.S. Strategic Command's_@REL War_Gaming_Center_@ORG back there at Offutt_Air_Force_Base_in_Omaha_@ORG, to help enable and challenge our thinking with the ability to look at alternative scenarios, some plausible today and some unthinkable tomorrow," the admiral explained.
"We need to grow innovative leaders, identify new operational concepts and continue to develop cutting-edge_technology_@TECH so we can continue to evolve our ideas on how to deter our adversaries and potential adversaries and, of course, assure our allies.
"Finding Problems, Plucking Them OutBut Haney said the nation would not have a credible strategic deterrent today if it were not for the men and women, military and civilian, "who conduct and contribute to our strategic_deterrent_mission_@DOC day in and day out, across all areas.
From under the sea to geosynchronous orbit, they are making concrete contributions to our security 24/7, 365 days a year.
"About the much-publicized problems over the past year with some members of the nuclear force, Haney said that when such problems are found, no matter where they are, "we pluck [them] out of our system   and get through some root-cause analysis to figure out what we should be doing associated with that particular problem.
"He added, "When you look at 90 percent of our team, [they] come to work every day to do the right thing, passionate over the mission.
"In any organization, the admiral said, "You have to continue to work on that other percentage of folks   and in this case I'm very happy that we found the problem, eradicated the problem from our system and went to work with this Nuclear_Enterprise_Review_@ORG business to work on those problems.
"Charged About the MissionHaney_@P1 said he spent 2014 traveling and meeting with all of those involved in the strategic_deterrent_mission_@DOC.
"I can say unequivocally that those folks are fired up and charged about the mission," he said.
"I think the rest of us need to support them in how we talk about it and associate it with the plans we have now.
"The admiral added, "I am proud of working with those great Americans.

31, 2012 - 01:57PM   |By KATE_BRANNEN_@P1   |Filed UnderWorld NewsAmericasTo meet_@REL the Budget_Control_Act_@DOC's caps for defense spending, the U.S._Senate_Appropriations_defense_subcommittee_@ORGtransferred_$5_billion_out_of_@REL the Pentagon's base budget into a separate spending bill for operations in Afghanistan.The subcommittee recommends $511 billion for DoD's base budget and $93 billion for overseas_contingency_operations_(OCO)_@TECH, for a total of $604.5 billion.
The Pentagon requested_$88_billion_in_@REL OCO funding.When asked where the extra OCO money came from, an aide_@REL to Sen._Daniel_Inouye_@P1, D-Hawaii_@P1, chairman_@REL of the Senate_Appropriations_Committee_@ORG, said the money had been transferred from one bill to the other to keep the base budget within the budget law's new spending caps.
The Pentagon's contingency funds are exempt from the federal discretionary spending caps.The panel looked to transfer anything it considered to be war-related, she said.This is the first of the 2013 defense bills that stays within the Budget_Control_Act_@DOC's spending caps, including the president's request.Funding for the Pentagon this year is nearly $29 billion less than was appropriated in 2012, primarily due to the drawdown of forces in Afghanistan, Inouye said.The $511 billion does not include military construction or nuclear weapons_program_@PROGs managed_by_@REL the Department_of_Energy_@ORG, both of which are included in separate appropriations bills.Within the top line, the Senate_panel_@ORGmade_several_adjustments_to_@REL the Pentagon's spending request, including 475 reductions to programs requested in the budget.For example, the subcommittee cut $3.8 billion in "prior year funds that are excess to defense needs due to program terminations, schedule delays or contract savings," a subcommittee statement said.The subcommittee endorsed a plan from the Senate_Armed_Services_Committee_@ORG to pause_all_force_structure_changes_proposed_by_@REL the Air Force until an independent national commission can weigh in.
"The bill directs the use of existing funds for procurements of the C-27 Spartan [aircraft_@WEA] and the RQ-4 Global_Hawk_@WEA Block 30," the subcommittee statement reads.
The Air Force had_proposed_canceling_both_programs_in_@REL its 2013 budget request.The bill would also add $800 million to sustain current Air Force structure.After making its reductions, the subcommittee redirected that money to where it saw shortfalls.For example, the subcommittee recommends adding advance procurement dollars for an additional Virginia-class_submarine_@WEA and an amphibious_ship_@WEA.
It also reverses the Navy_@ORG's proposal_to_"prematurely_retire"_@REL seven cruisers_@WEA and two amphibious_ship_@WEAs by providing $2.4 billion to keep them operating through 2014.The bill adds $1 billion to the National Guard and Reserve equipment account.According to a subcommittee statement, funds were added for Army helicopters_@WEA, including Sikorsky's_@REL UH-60_Black_Hawk_@WEA and Boeing's_@REL CH-47_Chinook_@WEA and AH-64 Apache_@WEA.The bill also increases funds to complete development of the Army's_Enhanced_Medium_Altitude_Reconnaissance_Surveillance_System_@WEA and adds_$142_million_for_@REL high-definition video sensors_@WEA requested_by_@REL U.S._Special_Operations_Command.The_subcommittee_@ORG also recommends adding $194 million for additional Patriot_PAC-3_missiles_@WEA.
It would increase funds to continue Abrams tank production, which the Army has said it would like to temporarily stop so that it can fund higher priority items.The bill would fully fund the requested number of Lockheed_@ORG Martin-built F-35_@WEA Joint Strike Fighters, the Pentagon's_biggest_and_most_expensive_weapon_program_@REL.The subcommittee recommends adding $500 million to the Missile_Defense_Agency_@ORG, including_$211_billion_for_@REL Iron Dome, a rocket-defense_system_@WEA being developed jointly for Israel.For Afghanistan, the bill would provide $5 billion for the Afghanistan_Security_Forces_Fund_@PROG, $200 million for the Commander's_Emergency_Response_Program_@PROG and $350 million for the Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund.The full Senate_Appropriations_Committee_@ORG plans to mark up the bill Aug. 2, when several lawmakers will offer their own amendments.While the four key committees have now spoken, final decisions have not been made.
The House_of_Representatives_@ORG has passed its version of the defense author_@P2ization and appropriations bills but the Senate has not, with no plans to take up these measures until after the August congressional recess and the Democratic and Republican national conventions.docno: 454513Pratt_&_Whitney_@ORG Statement_on_@RELDOT&E_Report_@DOC(Source: Pratt_&_Whitney_@ORG; issued Jan 20, 2015)Similar to previous reports, the latest DOT&E F-35_@WEA report points to the tremendous amount of positive progress made by the F-35_@WEA program last year.
The F135_engine_@WEA specifically has averaged 98 percent mission availability, achieved more than 26,000 ground test hours, more than 21,500 flight hours, and powered more than 750 vertical landings.The F135 proved its durability through very rigorous live fire testing, and the engine also performed exceptionally well during carrier trials_from_@REL the USS_Nimitz_@WEA in November, powering the F-35_@WEAC without a single instance of unscheduled engine maintenance.To date, we have delivered 183 production engines to our customers.This DOT&E_report_@DOC lists propulsion issues that are well known to the F-35_@WEA Joint Program Office and the Services.
These issues have been well documented and we are aligned with our customers on solutions.We have validated and approved an upgrade to the fleet to address the Eglin event, eliminated the flight restrictions on the SDD_fleet_@WEA, and begun implementing changes for the remainder of the fleet.The F-35_@WEA program is 60 percent through flight test development.
We expect to learn things in development testing, and we will apply lessons learned to field the most technologically advanced and reliable engine for the warfighter.
2014 was a year of great momentum for the F-35_@WEA program on all fronts.We remain extremely confident we'll be able to support our customers' future major program milestones, including U.S. Marine_Corps_@ORG Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in 2015 and U.S._Air_Force_@ORG IOC in 2016.
( EDITOR'S NOTE: Contrasting with Pratt's highly (excessively ) optimistic statement above, here is what the latest_(FY2014)_OT&E_report_@DOC actually says about the F135_engine_@WEA (emphasis in bold typeface is ours):-- Nowhere does the report state that "The F135_engine_@WEA specifically has averaged 98 percent mission availability," as claimed above by Pratt, nor does it mention "750 vertical landings. "
-- What the report actually says is that " Aircraft_@WEA availability was flat over most of the past year, maintaining an average for the fleet of 37 percent for the 12-month rolling period. "
This is exactly the same as reported a year ago, in the 2013 report.
In other words, there is no improvement whatsoever in availability .-- "Inspections of the engines on all variants led to discoveries on nine production and test aircraft_@WEA requiring engine replacement. "
(page 45) In other words, one in ten F135_engine_@WEAs has the same defect, and must be replaced.-- "Availability of the operational test aircraft_@WEA will_continue_to_be_[adversely]_affected_in_@REL CY15_@WEA and CY16_@WEA by the depot time required for [engine] modifications. "
(Page 40)"It is [still] not clear what occurred differently than expected in the air_vehicle_@WEA and/or engine that caused the excessive rubbing" which led to the June 23 catastrophic failure.
(page 45)-- "Additional details and analyses of the uncontained F135 fan blade release and subsequent fuel fire in an F-35_@WEAA at Eglin_AFB_@ORG in June are needed to support and update the existing engine vulnerability assessment. "
(page 42)-- "The uncontained F135 fan blade release and subsequent fuel fire in an F-35_@WEAA at Eglin_AFB_@ORG in June provides an additional data point that needs to be reviewed and analyzed to support the F-35_@WEA vulnerability assessment. "
(page 57)-- Operating restrictions stemming from the engine failure remain in force, and "must_be_relieved_for_@REL the test aircraft_@WEA such that all blocked test points are made available. "

AM_General_@ORG, Lockheed_@ORG Martin, and Oshkosh_@ORG (pictured) are competing.
Source: IHS/Daniel WasserblyKey PointsThe size and deployability of JLTV_@WEAs is_questioned_by_@REL the Pentagon's_@REL director of operational test and evaluationTesters_@P1 found that USMC_@ORG amphibious assaults would suffer from the added time needed to deploy JLTV_@WEAsPentagon testers have found that Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV_@WEA) prototypes are slow to deploy from ship to shore and, therefore, leaves US Marine_Corps_@ORG (USMC_@ORG) units "vulnerable to threats".The Director_of_Operational_Test_and_Evaluation_@P2 annual report on the previous year's testing, released on 20 January, found that during developmental test/operational test (DT/OT) events, USMC_@ORG units_with_@REL JLTV_@WEAs were able to execute amphibious assault missions, but were hampered by the new trucks' lack of deployability.
"The JLTV_@WEAs have large visual signature and their slow manoeuvre time from ship to shore prevents a Marine Expeditionary Unit from executing assault missions with tactical surprise, increases the time to close combat power ashore, and renders the unit vulnerable to threats," the report said.
"Testing showed that JLTV_@WEAs are slower to load, prepare for fording, and transition to manoeuvre ashore than HMMWV_[Humvees]_@WEA" that they are meant to replace, the document said.
Testers_@P1 explained that the issues were caused by the JLTV_@WEA's overall larger size (vehicle suspensions are dropped so they can better fit in amphibious_ship_@WEAs) and "delays that occur while awaiting suspension mode, and other vehicle adjustments" such as adjusting tyre pressure.A spokesman_for_the_Army_Program_Executive_Office_for_Combat_Support_&_Combat_Service_Support_@P3 declined to comment on whether the office has developed a plan to address deficiencies outlined in the report.The DT/OT events occurred in April 2014, with US Army and USMC_@ORG units using_@REL CH-47F_Chinook_@WEA and CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters_@WEA for an air assault mission, and a USMC_@ORG unit using_@REL Landing_Craft_Utility_vessels_@WEA for amphibious assault missions.Testers_@P1 found that units with JLTV_@WEAs - and organic_armour_assets_@WEA - can execute air assault missions.However, "the three JLTV_@WEA contractor vehicles were more difficult to rig, de-rig, and load weapons due to vehicle height and lack of vehicle handholds and footholds than HMMWV," the report said.
"They had limited space to carry crew, mission_essential_equipment_@WEA, weapons, and their sustainment load because of the small interior compartment.
"The DT/OT revealed that JLTV_@WEAs have better manoeuvrability in soft soil and better fording capability than legacy Humvees, but crew visibility is lower "because of smaller windows, placement of mission_equipment_@WEA, and positioning of window panels".ANALYSISIt is no surprise that JLTV_@WEAs have_a_larger_'visual_signature'_than_the_smaller_@REL Humvee; they are indeed bigger vehicles and ride higher from the ground to protect against underbelly mine blasts.However, it is notable that this larger size affects the speed at which marines can prepare the vehicles for battle (due to time spent raising the suspension, inflating tyres, and climbing to load equipment).The USMC_@ORG has_at_times_appeared_a_reluctant_customer_for_@REL the JLTV_@WEA as the corps is trying to get lighter and more mobile after years spent fighting land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with heavier platforms.
Marine_planners_@P3 had accepted the size and weight trade-off to gain more protection, but it will be interesting to see if the deployability issue can be resolved or be justified.Either way, the question must be answered soon because the USMC_@ORG's_@REL planned 5,500 JLTV_@WEAs are to be bought early in the production run and an initial operating capability is scheduled for fiscal year 2018.Related article: AUSA Winter 2014: Army to seek new medium truck family in mid-2020s(585 words)Related IHS ProductsIHS Jane's Defence: PlatformsIHS Jane's Defence: Air & SpaceIHS Jane's Defence: LandIHS Jane's Defence: SeaIHS Jane's Defence: Land PlatformsIHS Jane's Land Warfare Platforms: Armoured Fighting VehiclesIHS Jane's Land Warfare Platforms: Artillery & Air DefenceIHS Jane's Land Warfare Platforms: Logistics, Support & UnmannedIHS Jane's Land Warfare Platforms: System UpgradesIHS Jane's Defence WeeklyBy posting a comment you confirm that you have read and accept our Posting Rules and our Terms of Use of this site.
