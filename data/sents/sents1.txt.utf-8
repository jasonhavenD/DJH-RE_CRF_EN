docno: 1111Transition services now mandatory for soldiersBy Jim Tice - Staff writerPosted : Tuesday Apr 3, 2012 16:44:56 EDTFORT KNOX, Ky. - Soldiers now must participate in transition services before they leave active duty.An execution order requiring them to make use of the services is in force throughout the Army.The order applies to all soldiers who are leaving active duty, whether they are Regular Army members who are separating or retiring or reservists demobilizing after six months or more on active duty.The order, which implements a directive issued last year by Army Secretary John McHugh, further requires that transition processing begin at least 12 months before a soldier leaves active duty and that the soldier's commander oversee the process.The new procedures will be bolstered later this year when the Veterans Opportunity to Work Act is implemented Nov. 20 for all the military services.
"From the Army standpoint, we are planning for that mandate, and getting additional resources to support implementation across the active and reserve components," said Walter M. Herd, director of the Army Career and Alumni Program.This will result in about a 300 percent increase in the number of soldiers participating in transition services, Herd said.ACAP, a longtime Army program, assists departing soldiers, family members and Army career civilians in preparing for civilian life through myriad counseling, education, job-preparation and job-search services at 54 centers in the U.S. and overseas.The centers are staffed by counselors who have graduate degrees in counseling and who can link up departing soldiers with training and services offered by the Army and other government agencies, such as the Labor and Veterans Affairs departments.ACAP also operates a new 24-hour, seven-day-a-week call center here, and an interactive website for the virtual delivery of information and services, to include counseling.Regular Army soldiers leaving active duty should begin their transition 24 months in advance of retirement and 18 to 12 months in advance of separation, Herd said.
"Ideally, the soldier should go to an ACAP center, receive a pre-separation briefing and begin to map out his or her transition plan," he said.
"This will be an individual plan to lay out how the person will transition from being a soldier to being a civilian.
"The plan will include what classes the soldier will attend, and specifically what preparations should be made, whether he is leaving service for college or to enter the civilian work force.ACAP works closely with the Army Continuing Education System and can coordinate services for departing soldiers who plan to attend college or who require professional accreditation.For example, if a soldier wants to become a plumber after leaving the Army, ACAP and ACES counselors can assist the soldier in becoming professionally accredited.Herd said reservists normally are mobilized for a year, so they need to begin their transition processing immediately upon coming on active duty.
"For most of the Reserve soldiers who are going back to the same job they left, the transition will be simpler than for those who don't have an existing job," Herd said.Commanders' roleA second major goal of the execution order requires commanders to be responsible for ensuring that their soldiers are successfully transitioned.
"This is really a big change, as in the past, transition processing really was a staff issue, rather than a commander responsibility," Herd said.The new system is designed so that commanders will be notified when their soldiers begin transitioning processing.
"The commander can delegate the monitoring of a soldier's transition to subordinate officers and [noncommissioned officers], but he is responsible for making sure that the soldiers start the process at least 12 months out," Herd said.Officials expect that first sergeants and squad leaders will be major players in this process.The commander will then get periodic reports showing how many transitioning soldiers in the company, battalion or brigade have completed pre-separation counseling, prepared a résumé, attended briefings and other ACAP activities.
"The long-term plan is to monitor a soldier's transition processing through Army Career Tracker, a system for enlisted soldiers, officers and Army civilians to plot their career milestones.
"We aren't quite there yet, but we will get plugged into Career Tracker" Herd said.Herd, a retired colonel and former brigade commander, acknowledged that with the ongoing force alignment and drawdown programs, such as the Qualitative Service Program boards, some soldiers will be required to leave active duty early, and will not have a full year for transitioning processing.
"Under those conditions, we will start a soldier's transitioning processing as soon as possible," he said.docno: 111982 Missile ThreatA Project of the George C. Marshall and Claremont InstitutesSequestration, Obama Budget Cuts Threaten Much-Needed Missile DefenseRandy DuncanPosted on December 31, 2012 by editorDec.
30, 2012 - British military historian John Keegan once said, "It's a necessary quality of a diplomat or a politician that he will compromise.
Uncompromising politicians or diplomats get you into the most terrible trouble.
"That may never have been truer than it is today, as Congress struggles to come up with a deal to avoid sending our country over the fiscal cliff at year's end.It would be nice if Congress and the president would be inspired to take defense of the homeland more seriously.Perhaps most concerning are the draconian defense "sequestration" cuts that are set to take effect January 2, 2013.
The $500 billion reduction in military spending triggered by 2011's Budget Control Act would be added to the $487 billion the Obama administration already eliminated in this year's budget request.For months, lawmakers have been warned of the potential economic impact of these indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts.
A joint study between Dr. Stephen S. Fuller of George Mason University and Chmura Economics and Analytics showed that America could lose an estimated 2.14 million jobs if Congress does nothing to prevent the automatic sequestration cuts.But the effects of sequestration - on top of already reduced military spending on the president's watch - extend well-beyond our fragile economy.
Military brass and defense experts agree that such haphazard cuts would gut critical defense programs that protect this nation and our troops from harm.Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has said that "if additional efforts are made to go after the defense budget, I think it could have a serious impact in terms of our ability to implement" the Pentagon's stated defense strategy.
This is especially true in light of significant cuts already imposed.
As these cuts are beyond flesh and into the bone.
Further cuts now are threatening to become reckless endangerment of the American people.One urgent area of concern is missile defense, particularly in light of North Korea's successful long-range rocket test earlier this month.
While the White House deemed the launch a "highly provocative act," it was a stark reminder of the importance of investing in defensive systems that can both deter attacks and protect us increasing threats from rogue nations.Time and again our "Cold War" focused defense, diplomatic and intelligence apparatus and intelligentsia have been "surprised" by global events empowered by new social media.
Witness Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Syria, Libya and tumult in Mali.
One of the U.S. top defense and intelligence priorities is to prevent strategic surprise.
And yet the collective political group think is to apparently allow these multiple layered cuts to happen.
It is unconscionable.An immediate problem is that our current missile defense budget is woefully inadequate.
In total, the president lopped $3.6 billion off the projected budget for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) over the next 4 years.
This is in addition to the $1.4 billion reduction for MDA from 2009 to 2013.
"I'm disappointed, very much, in the reductions to the missile defense budget over the last four years, much of which has come at the expense of our homeland defense as well as the development of next-generation missile defense systems," retiring Sen. Jon Kyl, a noted defense hawk, told a recent forum sponsored by the American Foreign Policy Council.For example, the president's 2013 budget slashed the number of Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) - our first line of defense against a long-range missile attack from North Korea - from 44 interceptors to 30.
A third GBI site along the East Coast continues to be a hot topic on Capitol Hill, but the potential for funding such a program appears dim considering we aren't properly supporting the sites we already have in Alaska and California.
As Sen. Kyl aptly noted in his comments to AFPC , funding for GBIs has decreased from $2.5 billion annually under President Bush to only $1 billion under the Obama administration.The next-generation Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) has also been a target of significant cuts, this despite two high-profile, successful tests of the interceptor this spring and summer.Currently, the U.S. and Japanese navies are employing more than 130 first-generation SM-3s, but the upgraded missile, which is set to roll off production lines in 2015, offers enhanced capabilities to protect America and its allies.MDA's original plan was to buy 62 SM-3 "I-Bs" but in his 2013 budget President Obama cut that number to a meager 29 and sliced the I-B budget in half.
The timing could not be worse considering that commanders in the field are saying that our current inventories of SM-3s aboard Aegis ships are already insufficient.
A recent classified STRATCOM exercise, reported by InsideDefense.com, confirmed the assertion of a ballistic missile shortfall.Most significantly, these cuts to GBIs and SM-3s do not take into account the prospect of sequestration.
In a letter to Congress last month, Panetta warned that sequestration would result in an additional "23 percent cut in weapons program would drive up unit costs and lead to reductions in quantity of one third or more.
"While both Democrats and Republicans can agree that current budget deficits are unsustainable, shrinking the U.S. missile defense budget at a time when threats are exponentially increasing could prove pennywise but pound foolish.
After all, North Korea is far from the only hostile nation on our radar.
Iran and Syria remain aggressive, and the threat of Syria's weapons falling into the hands of jihadi-minded militias poses a very real threat to global security.Avoiding such a fate will take real compromise from Congress and the president over the next few days.
Without a deal to avoid even more severe cuts to defense, the American people may well be in "the most terrible trouble.
"One thing that should be clear to the collective intelligentsia and politicians, strategic surprise will happen.
The American people and our allies just don't deserve to have a North Korean or Iranian missile land on our heads because we failed to properly fund missile defense.Randy Duncan is a retired Navy captain who served at the Defense Missile and Space Intelligence Center and the Defense Intelligence Agency.This entry was posted in Publications and tagged Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) , Iran , Jon Kyl , Leon Panetta , North Korea , Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) , Syria , Budget , Missile Defense Agency by editor .

They also considered deployed forces themselves in theaters of operation against ballistic missile attacks armed with WMD or conventional munitions, and protection of U.S. allies, partners, and host nations against ballistic-missile-delivered WMD and conventional weapons.Consistent with U.S. policy and the congressional tasking, the committee conducted its analysis on the basis that it is not a mission of U.S. BMD systems to defend against large-scale deliberate nuclear attacks by Russia or China.
Making Sense of Ballistic Missile Defense: An Assessment of Concepts and Systems for U.S. Boost-Phase Missile Defense in Comparison to Other Alternatives suggests that great care should be taken by the U.S. in ensuring that negotiations on space agreements not adversely impact missile defense effectiveness.
This report also explains in further detail the findings of the committee, makes recommendations, and sets guidelines for the future of ballistic missile defense research.Download PDFThis entry was posted in Publications and tagged Boost Phase by editor .

6, 2013 - Amid reports that China is gearing up to conduct one more anti-satellite weapons test (ASAT) putting US Global Positioning System (GPS) at risk, Chinese state media today asserted that Beijing had the right to carry out the test as it is a "trump card" against Washington.China may be gearing up to perform a controversial ASAT test this month, perhaps in the next week or two, US media report said.
"In 2007 and 2010, China conducted anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons tests, both on January 11.
Rumours circulating for the past few months suggest that some within the US defence and intelligence community believe China is preparing to conduct another ASAT test," Union of Concerned Scientists, a Cambridge-based body of scientists reported.China's previous tests caused concern in India too with assertions by the Indian defence officials that New Delhi also should acquire such a capability.
"Just before Christmas, a high-ranking US defence official told us that the Obama administration was very concerned about an imminent Chinese ASAT test," Gregory Kulacki, China project manager of the group and senior analyst reported two days ago.
"Given these high-level administration concerns, and past Chinese practice, there seems to be a strong possibility China will conduct an ASAT test within the next few weeks.
What kind of test and what the target might be is unclear," Kulacki wrote in his report.Reacting to the report, an editorial in China's state-run Global Times said today that concerns that the test will put the US strategic satellites at risk is "over blown".
"China reportedly conducted an anti-satellite test in early 2007, which caused a great uproar.
Some analysts said that even if China really once again launches a test, it will not strike down satellites, but invalidate them," it said without stating whether the test would be conducted.
"Whether China will launch new anti-satellite test is still unknown.
However China should continue substantive research on striking satellites.
In the foreseeable future, gap between China and the US cannot be eliminated by China's development of space weapons," the editorial said.
"The US advantage is overwhelming.
Before strategic uncertainties between China and the US can disappear, China urgently needs to have an outer space trump card", it said.
"China's public policy is peaceful use of space, which is also China's real desire.
China has no interest in launching a large-scale space race with the US.
China and Russia jointly initiated a programme to avoid an arms race in outer space in 2008, but this proposal was refused by the US", it said.
"Against this background, it is necessary for China to have the ability to strike US satellites.
This deterrent can provide strategic protection to Chinese satellites and the whole country's national security", it said.
"The US will continue to harass and even obstruct China's developing of its space capabilities.
China should make tactical adjustments to reduce trouble.
It is key for China to have the ability of strategic retaliation.
It is a safeguard for China to deter the US from taking risky action against China in this period of great transition," it said.The planned test by China comes in the backdrop of the launch of China's own GPS called BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) currently being used by Chinese military and a number of official bodies.China plans to launch 20 more satellites to improve its functioning.Some US officials suspect China may want to go higher than it did in either 2007 or 2010, targeting an object 12,000 miles or so above Earth's surface.This ability to reach Medium-Earth Orbit (MEO) could theoretically put the constellation of US Global Positioning System navigational satellites at risk, a report in Space.Com said.
"But there are good reasons for China not to destroy a satellite at this orbit, including that China plans to use this part of space," Kulacki wrote.
"Creating debris, as it now understands, would threaten its own satellites.
Over the next several years, China plans to place more than 20 new navigational satellites in MEO," he wrote.Kulacki urged the Obama Administration to attempt to dissuade China from conducting any more destructive ASAT tests.Both the United States and the Soviet Union abandoned such tests as their space programmes matured, he notes.
"Hopefully, China will eventually come to a similar conclusion," Kulacki wrote adding that "beginning a meaningful bilateral dialogue on space security between the United States and China could hasten the day.

Frank Wolf (R-Va. ), chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds the U.S. space agency, that they support his panel's approach to commercial crew vehicle development.
"It seems unlikely that NASA will receive significant budgetary relief in the foreseeable future," the three retired astronauts wrote in a May 4 letter to Wolf.
"Consequently, it is mandatory to maximize return on the limited funds available to access low Earth orbit.
An early downselect would seem to be prudent in order to maximize the possibility of developing a crew-carrying spacecraft in time to be operationally useful.
"House members are scheduled to debate the Wolf panel's response to NASA's fiscal 2013 budget request on Tuesday.
Report language accompanying the Wolf bill, which was approved by the full House Appropriations Committee, calls for "an immediate downselect to a single competitor or, at most, the execution of a leader-follower paradigm in which NASA makes one large award to a main commercial partner and a second small award to a backup partner.
"NASA prefers to maintain competition among companies vying for funds under its commercial crew development (CCDev) seed-money effort as long as possible, in the belief that it will ultimately cost less to develop a vehicle that way.
Under pressure from some of the CCDev competitors, the agency also opted to continue the program under Space Act Agreements, rather than using the more restrictive Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) approach.Wolf's panel argued that a quick downselect would allow NASA to move back to the FAR procurement approach and avoid a complicated transition from funding more than one company under the Space Act to a FAR procurement.
The three Apollo commanders, who earlier urged Congress to resist White House plans to hand off human access to the private sector, agreed that a Space Act procurement "would be unlikely to provide the documentation that we normally depend upon to provide high confidence in reaching our technical goals.
""We all agree that our country has painted itself into a corner and does not now, nor will for many years, have a U.S. government craft suitable for carrying cargo or crew to the International Space Station," the astronauts wrote.
"The reputation of our country and the potential liability associated with carrying United States and international crews to and from the ISS dictates that we do everything possible to ensure that any commercial crew service meets standards equal to those that we would enforce would the craft be government owned and operated.
"docno: 114762 Missile ThreatA Project of the George C. Marshall and Claremont InstitutesRussia to create new missiles to compete with U.S.RBTHPosted on January 9, 2013 by editorIt looks like the Russian military and the military-industrial complex have decided to prepare seriously for overcoming the American missile defense system.
Work is underway simultaneously on two strategic missiles of different classes.According to Sergei Karakaev, the commander of Russiaa  s Strategic Missile Forces, these is a heavy, 100-ton, liquid-propellant intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that should outperform the world's most powerful R-36M2 Voevoda (NATO reporting name: SS-18 Satan), and a solid-fuel ICBM scheduled to replace the fifth-generation Yars systems (the RS-24 and the Topol-M).
'Since the potential of solid-fuel ICBMs could become insufficient for overcoming the American missile defense system going forward, a heavy liquid-propellant ICBM is needed to perform this task.
Such an ICBM will allow the creation of a non-nuclear, high-precision, strategic weapon with a practically global range, unless the United States abandons its program,' Karakaev said.This is the first time Russia has spoken about creating a new solid-fuel missile.
According to Gen. Karakaev, several launches of a prototype of this missile took place in 2012' most recently on Oct. 24.This puts an end to the debate on whether Russia's Strategic Missile Forces need a heavyweight liquid-propellant missile.Russia undertook a large-scale modernization of the Topol family in the 1990s and adopted the Topol-M silos (NATO reporting name: SS-27) in 2000, followed by the mobile Topol-M2 several years ago.
It is the new Topol and the newly adopted RS-24 Yars that will be gradually replacing the decommissioned, first-generation, solid-fuel missiles.But liquid-propellant missiles still form the backbone of the strategic deterrence forces: the UR-100N (NATO reporting name: SS-19 Stiletto) and the D -36M (U.S. Department of Defense and NATO reporting name: SS-18 Satan).
These, however, are obsolete and will have to be retired over the next few years.New missiles have been slow in arriving to the Russia's armed forces.
According to an estimate by Leonid Kalashnikov, deputy chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, Russia could receive 100-105 new ICBMs by 2015.
If the bet remains on, the single-warhead Topol-M and the three-warhead Yars-24 would be able to carry a total of 110-115 warheads.
At the same time, the United States is planning to deploy 900 ballistic missile interceptors worldwide by 2015.The United States withdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2001 and is no longer limited by any restrictions on building up the quantity and quality of such means.
According to Karakaev, it is possible that America could deploy anti-missile defenses in space.Russia's military and political leadership was counting on successful negotiations with the United States on missile defense.
However, the negotiations have ended in a deadlock; Washington's persistent deployment of surface- and sea-based anti-missile defenses, coupled with a general deterioration of bilateral relations, have forced the Russian leadership to consider more decisive actions.This is where the idea of a missile capable of carrying a dividing warhead with a large number of individually targeted blocks (which would also have a long range) originated.
Russia already has such missiles' the above-mentioned liquid-propellant UR-100N and R-36M.
However, these missiles have been on combat duty since the late 1980s, and their service life is nearing an end.Development of new missiles was suspended in the 1990s, when the Strategic Missile Forces were expected to be fully converted to lightweight, solid-fuel missile complexes.
However, lightweight missiles have not been able to become a full-fledged replacement for liquid-propellant giants.According to Yuri Zaitsev, an expert at the Academy of Engineering Sciences, 'It's unlikely that the lightweight Topol-M and the Bulava [ a new sea-based solid-fuel Topol-M based missile ] could serve as a worthy substitute for the decommissioned missiles.
'Nonetheless, Russia is not planning to abandon its solid-fuel missiles either.
Solid-fuel missiles are the best match for mobile complexes.
This means that Russia will continue developing a replacement for both types of its active-duty missiles.This entry was posted in News and tagged ICBM , R-36M2 Voevoda , Russia , SS-18 Satan , Topol , by editor .

"The research, conducted in the fourth quarter of 2012, suggests that the market for services provided by business and technology consultancies to develop and implement the systems required to generate data insights, is growing at a compound annual rate of more than 15%.
The global market for these services will almost double over the next four years, from an estimated $54.5 billion in 2012 to $96.9 billion in 2016, according to the Pringle & Company report.The overall business intelligence and analytics market, made up of both software and services, was worth $79 billion in 2012, and will now grow at a rate of approximately 16% annually to reach $143.3 billion in 2016.Although enterprises have been grappling with big data headaches for years, the recognition that CIOs need external help to deliver rapidly accessible business insights to everyday users is new.
"Across the whole spectrum of business intelligence, analytics is the area of most interest at the moment," said Tom Pringle, author of the report.
"While organizations have always been interested in understanding operational performance, CIOs are now seeing more business-led demand -- from the board level down to individual business heads .

]Most CIOs who are used to delivering standard key performance indicator reports are not geared up to deliver this level of dynamic information, and now face a range of issues.
These include providing flexible mobile accessibility across a growing number of devices; compensating for users' lack of data literacy; achieving the required speed of information delivery; and ensuring the quality and integrity of source data, Pringle said.As they seek to satisfy growing demand for timely and specific business insight, CIOs must draw on a range of services.
These range from assessing and improving the quality of target data sources and making resulting analyses comprehensible to users, to determining the exact needs of users and ensuring that the particular information they require can be delivered to them at the point of need.The Pringle report highlights the indispensable role of external services right across the board -- from management consultancies to technical, deployment and maintenance providers -- in developing an organization's capability to harness the value of data.
Its conclusions support the general rule that for every dollar spent on software for business intelligence, more than two are spent on external service providers, as companies seek to plug gaps in their internal data analysis capabilities and associated IT skills.The telecommunications and financial services sectors have long exhibited strong demand for external services, but interest is now growing across a number of other sectors, including healthcare , as providers seek to improve patient care by establishing a more holistic view of patients, and travel , as airlines, for example, try to sustain the customer experience yet counteract rising costs.Recognizing the opportunity, outsourced service providers are now ramping up their services and new players are entering the market, Pringle said.
"Business intelligence, and specifically data analytics, is one of the highest growth areas in IT generally.
What's particularly interesting as service providers tap into this opportunity is the entry of non-traditional players.
Among them are industry professionals with a lot of operational experience.
They are able to complement data and technology experience with a deep knowledge of how particular organizations need to use data for strategic and competitive advantage.
Their involvement, alongside data experts, helps deliver the speed of results that is so critical now.
Even very large firms don't have all of the skills they need in house, so it makes sense to partner with relevant experts.
"Companies shouldn't underestimate the groundwork needed to enable more dynamic, business-driven data analytics, Pringle added.
"The 'bigger' and more strategic data becomes, the more important it is that the quality is good," he noted.
"Presentation is important too, as most users won't be data experts. "
To this end, technology providers need to work harder to hide the complexity of the data, he said, so that only unambiguous and relevant content is served up to users -- aiding their efficiency, rather than distracting them further.Pointing to CIOs' priorities over the year ahead, Pringle concluded, "To avoid projects that spiral out of control, organizations should start small, focusing on where the demand is coming from in the business: is it to understand sales performance in more detail, for example, or to analyze costs in the supply chain  The sensible advice is probably to look at specific issues rather than take a big-bang approach -- then, if data quality turns out to be an issue, you might be able to get away with a fairly packaged service from an IT provider.
"Emerging database technology promises to automate more analysis.
Here's where it could replace relational systems.

Caine Finnerty, president of Watt Fuel Cell, explains the SOFC technology to Senator Jack M. Martins and Senator Dean Skelos during their visit to WATT in 2011.Dr.
The company has recently concluded testing on a 500-watt propane-powered unit and is planning to demonstrate a 1-kilowatt systems by the end of this year.
"Being able to use accessible fuel is key to the success of the fuel cell industry, and we've focused on our technology's ability to use readily available gaseous and liquid fuels for commercial and military applications," Dr. Caine Finnerty, president of WATT Fuel Cell said.
Propane and natural gas will be used commercially, while liquid fuels such as Diesel (D2) and JP-8 will be suitable for the military.As part of the system's commercialization WATT has recently refined its patented cell manufacturing process, substantially reducing production times while increasing part quality, performance and yield.
"Our process not only makes cost-effective stack manufacturing a reality, but also permits manufacturing scalability to quickly flex, matching market demand," said Benjamin Emley, technology director at the company.
According to Emley, the company is presently scaling into full-rate production at its manufacturing facility on Long Island.The SOFC working principleThe SOFC working principleEarlier this week Parker Hannifin and WATT Fuel Cell Corp. embarked on a strategic licensing and supply agreement to bring WATT's propane-driven based products to commercial markets.
The agreement will provide Parker's an exclusive license of WATT Fuel Cell's low-cost balance-of-plant (BoP) technology and exclusive stack supply for use in 500 to 3000 watt RV, marine and over-the-road trucking markets.
Parker will manufacture the BoP and controls and also integrate the fuel cell stacks into complete, packaged SOFC products.While the agreement with Parker aims at the commercial sector, the SOFC fuel-cell has many military applications as well, particularly with systems operating on JP-8 fuel.
With such capability the fuel cell provides a powerful, quiet and logistically efficient energy source for various users, including robotics or unattended communications devices.
WATT Fuel Cell has already integrated systems operating on both gaseous and liquid fuel.
The fuel cell system replaces batteries offering six times the capacity for a given net weight (the weight of batteries providing less than 200 Wh/kg can be replaced by JP-8 fuel cell driving more than 12,000 Wh/kg).
Key for performance improvement is the reduction in the size of the fuel cell and its electronic control circuits.Typical applications of SOFC employ cylindrical ducts flowing the fuel and air, interconnected to react and generate electricity.Micro-tubular SOFC fuel cell design geometries promise relatively fast start up times, typically on the order of minutes.WATT Fuel Cell has identified several key applications within the military including UAVs, UGV's, battery chargers and primary power to forward deployed forces.
"We have taken a simplified approach to system and stack design in order to streamline production and product support.
Reduction in system cost and standardization of componentry across various power platforms will enable us to provide a better product to the end user" Emley explained.Based on the content of this article, you might be interested in the following posts:Compact JP-8 Diesel-Powered Fuel-Cell Demonstrates Long Operation Durability Compact JP-8 Diesel-Powered Fuel-Cell Demonstrates LongHorizon Fuel Cell Tested on Elbit Systems' Skylark I-LE Mini UAV Horizon Fuel Cell Tested on Elbit Systems' Skylark I-LEBirdEye 650LE Mini-UAV Uses Fuel Cell to Fly Six HourStalker EX Mini-UAV Set for Eight Hour Endurance Missions Stalker EX Mini-UAV Set for Eight Hour Endurance Missions6th Annual Military Energy Alternatives ConferenceRelated Posts6th Annual Military Energy Alternatives ConferenceSkylark 1LE Adapts for the U.S. MilitaryTailoring Unmanned Platforms for New MissionsGlobe-i Zooming in to a "Window of Interest"Copyright   2013 Defense Update - Military Technology & Defense News.

"An earlier Sandia study concluded that such a UAV could be tested within a decade.
It will not be, because it is nuclear-powered, and politics make it impossible.
But the technical and operational case is powerful.Non-solar-powered UAVs, such as Boeing's hydrogen-fueled Phantom Eye and Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion, are expected to deliver multi-day endurance.
But they cannot carry large payloads or provide much electrical power, and are slow, so have to be forward-based.
They are also restricted to propeller propulsion, which makes stealth unattainable.The Sandia-Northrop activity is linked to studies of nuclear-powered UAVs in the U.S. Air Force that started in the mid-1990s, not long after the Advanced Airborne Reconnaissance System, a conventionally powered long-endurance stealth drone planned in the 1980s to track Soviet mobile nuclear missiles, was terminated.Sandia was heavily involved by 2001.
A paper from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments noted that Sandia's Special Projects Department had proposed an "extremely long-endurance vehicle (ELEV)" or "air-breathing satellite. "
The ELEV could fly at 70,000 ft. and stay on station for six months to a year with up to a 5,000-lb.
payload.
According to Sandia, building a modern nuclear-turbojet engine "would not be an R&D project," the CSBA report stated, "but rather an engineering development effort that could culminate in a flight test within a decade.
"Boeing's Phantom Works was involved with the design of the nuclear UAV, a high-subsonic, blended-wing body.
Propulsion was based on concepts that emerged from the Airborne Nuclear Power (ANP) program of the 1950s, which was intended to lead to a strategic missile carrier that would remain on continuous airborne alert for a week or more.
It combined two turbojet engines with a reactor.
ANP looked at two designs: "direct cycle," in which the engine airflow cooled the reactor; and "indirect cycle," in which a liquid-metal coolant carried heat from the reactor to the engine.The 2000-era UAV enjoyed three advantages over ANP, which struggled to reach a performance level where the aircraft could fly.
Two stemmed from the fact that it was a UAV, which could take advantage of the propulsion system's endurance.
Planners envisioned features such as magnetic engine bearings to eliminate oil.
Importantly, more than half the weight of the ANP propulsion system was radiation shielding, which could be reduced in a system that would not run at full power near humans.
(In the Sandia studies, the engines burned jet fuel for takeoff and landing. )
A USAF study of a Global Hawk with a nuclear engine indicated it might need only 2,700 lb.
of shielding.The third advantage was improved reactor technology.
Air Force interest in ELEV coincided with the winding-down of the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion technology program, in which Sandia was also involved.
SNTP started in 1987 as the Strategic Defense Initiative Office's Project Timberwind, aimed at producing a nuclear-thermal rocket (developing thrust by superheating hydrogen) for a missile interceptor, but was canceled after the Cold War.
A Timberwind rocket engine would have incorporated a particle bed reactor (PBR), with some designs weighing as little as 2,000 lb.
, using carbon-carbon and ceramic-matrix composites.New reactor designs are safer.
They "would only hurt you if they fell on you," it has been suggested, because of specially fabricated and shielded fuel elements and robust "poison" systems to perform an emergency shutdown.
It is not known whether a PBR or a different modern reactor technology was the basis for the ELEV concept or the Sandia-Northrop Grumman study, which covered eight heat sources, three power conversion systems, two dual-cycle propulsion systems and an electrical generation system.
However, it was stated in 2001 that the propulsion system would power the aircraft while delivering several hundred kilowatts to onboard radar, communications and electronic attack systems.
Conventional turbine engines optimized for range and fuel consumption and sized for typical UAVs struggle to deliver 50+ kw at altitude.12Next Pagedocno: 117565 Missile ThreatA Project of the George C. Marshall and Claremont InstitutesRussia Might Still Use Sea-Fired Nuclear Cruise MissilesChris SchneidmillerPosted on January 15, 2013 by editorJan.
14, 2013 - WASHINGTON - There is cause to suspect that Russia might be deploying some number of sea-launched cruise missiles tipped with nuclear warheads, two decades after the United States put its version of the weapon into storage, issue experts say.The Kremlin might also be developing a next-generation version of that same missile type as part of its broader nuclear forces modernization, according to some observers.If true, the missiles could present a complication to future U.S.-Russian arms control negotiations - and a stealthy threat in the unlikely event of a nuclear conflict.
'The sky is not falling.
I don't think that they're on the verge of deploying large numbers of new nuclear-armed cruise missiles,' said arms control specialist Jeffrey Lewis of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.
'But it's something that's worth taking seriously and thinking about.
And, if one is committed to doing more in the arms control field, this is a question that is going to come up.
'The United States definitively took its sole line of nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles, the Tomahawk land-attack system , off deployment in the early 1990s.
Russia's management of an arsenal with various types of such weapons has been less clear, according to Lewis.The U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed in July 1991 addressed only the class of weapons that generally have greater ranges and explosive yield than tactical nuclear arms intended for battlefield use.
However, the sides separately agreed to field no more than 880 nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles and to issue yearly declarations on the deployment counts, Lewis said.Just a few months later, President George H.W.Bush announced unilateral pullbacks of tactical nuclear arms under which the Navy would during 'normal circumstances' not carry nonstrategic nuclear missiles on surface vessels or attack submarines.At the time, the United States held about 350 Tomahawk nuclear cruise missiles that could be launched from sea against land targets, according to Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project for the Federation of American Scientists.
The Navy, prior to the White House order, kept about 100 of the missiles on attack submarines and other naval vessels on a regular basis, he said.The Soviets - and later the Russians - held a number of dual-capable cruise missiles for deployment on submarines and surface vessels, but only the SS-N-21 was intended as a land-attack weapon, according to Kristensen.
Production and deployment figures, though, are hard to come by.
'This is Russian nuclear weapons.
There's so much uncertainty,' he said.While then-Kremlin leaders Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin responded to Bush's move by pledging their own tactical weapons rollbacks, they did not 'unambiguously commit' to pulling nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles from attack submarines, Lewis said.The governments in Moscow and Washington never released details of the cruise-missile declarations, which are no longer required following the START treaty's expiration in 2009.
'It seems likely that Russia declared zero, because if it hadn't declared zero it may very well have turned into a political issue,' James Acton, a senior associate for nuclear policy with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in an interview.Lewis concurred.
'I suspect the Soviets (and Russians) did, in fact, declare zero, if only because I would expect any other number to leak,' he wrote in an October post on the Arms Control Wonk blog.The Obama administration announced the decommissioning of the sea-launched nuclear Tomahawks in its 2010 Nuclear Posture Review.
Russia, though, might be going in the other direction, Lewis said.Then-Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov stated in 2006 that nuclear weapons were being carried by three 'multipurpose (i.e.
attack)' submarines, rather than the ballistic-missile underwater craft, Lewis stated in his blog post.
News reports in recent years have suggested similar deployments.Kristensen, though, said that Ivanov's statement was indicative only of 'fumbled language' rather than demonstrating Russian nuclear cruise missiles were at sea.Russia has also faced scrutiny in the last couple years over efforts to sell a short-range cruise missile system that is designed to be hidden and fired from a shipping container.
The weapon is manufactured by the same firm that makes the SS-N-21 cruise missile.
'Although I suspect the intended audience for the containerized cruise missiles largely comprise tin-pot dictators some Russians apparently see stealth and mobility as a selling point,' Lewis told GSN .
'For Russia itself, submarines are probably the platform of choice.
'The nation's ongoing military modernization projects encompass a new attack submarine and new cruise missiles, according to Lewis, who directs his organization's East Asia Nonproliferation Program.
'They're working on a new cruise missile.
It's probably for air delivery, but one could imagine them converting them over' for sea deployment, he said.Among the rumors regarding Russia's cruise missiles is that a nuclear form of the SS-N-30 is being prepared for the Yasen-class atomic submarine Severodvinsk , Kristensen said.
"In 1991, the United States and the then-Soviet Union, as a political commitment, voluntarily agreed to cease deploying any nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles on surface ships or multipurpose submarines.
The United States has no definitive information that the Russian Federation is not abiding by this political commitment,' Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Monica Matoush said in a prepared statement to GSN.The Russian Embassy in Washington said last week it had no information on the matter.Experts acknowledged that the information is circumstantial rather than definitive, but said Moscow might see cause for fielding nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles or building new ones.Russian leaders seemingly believe that cruise missiles and other naval nuclear weapons have a role in countering stronger U.S. and NATO sea power, Kristensen stated by e-mail.
'Sea-launched cruise missiles provide a relatively stealthy and accurate option to hold at risk a variety of regional targets,' Lewis said in an e-mailed follow-up to a telephone interview.Having the missiles ready for use could be a hedge against burgeoning deployment of U.S. missile defense assets in Europe, Acton added.
Submarines could fire a sea-launched nuclear cruise missile from a significant distance - the SS-N-21 has a range of about 1,860 miles - and the weapon would have a greater chance of reaching its target than an air-dropped bomb, he said.
'We're dealing with very low-probability, high-consequence scenarios,' Acton added.
'But if you're thinking of what nuclear weapons are of more or less concern, then those features make Russian sea-launched cruise missiles of more concern.
'He said that development of new sea-based nuclear cruise missiles would not necessarily be based on 'cold-blooded' Russian strategizing.
Rather, they could derive from jockeying for influence between various weapons design bureaus.The missiles could pose a threat to Obama administration hopes for a follow-up to the New START nuclear arms control treaty that would address tactical as well as strategic nuclear arms , Lewis said.
The United States and Russia began implementing New START, which caps deployed long-range warheads at 1,550 and delivery vehicles at 700, in early 2011.Russia deploys various types of nonstrategic nuclear weapons , but could be particularly reluctant to allow inspection of vessels that might carry sea-launched nuclear cruise missiles as well as conventional weapons.
'Once the Russians spend a bazillion dollars on a new cruise missile, the chance of an arms control agreement is much, much lower,' Lewis said.
'So I'm definitely engaging in the debate in anticipation of a threat rather than in response to [one].
'An effort to resume SLCM data exchanges could help.
This might lead to other confidence-building measures and potentially some sort of agreement on the Russian weapons, Lewis has argued.The likelihood of Moscow and Washington actually agreeing to such measures in the existing strategic climate, though, is 'probably zero,' he said.This entry was posted in Publications and tagged Russia , SS-N-21 , SS-N-30 , Tomahawk , NATO , Nuclear Weapons , START Treaty by editor .

Nevertheless, there's no evidence that consumers are using Internet sites to diagnose themselves instead of consulting physicians, said Susannah Fox, associate director of the Pew Internet Project, in an interview with InformationWeek Healthcare .Overall, the study found, 81% of American adults had used the Internet, and 72% of Internet users had sought health information online in the previous 12 months.
Fifty-nine percent of online health information seekers tried to identify what kind of medical condition they had.Women outnumbered men within this group, and people who were young, white, high-income and highly educated were more likely than others to diagnose themselves or others on the Web, the survey found.Of the online diagnosers, 46% said that the condition they tried to diagnose needed the attention of a doctor, 38% said it could be taken care of at home, and 11% said it was either both or in between.Fifty-three percent of online diagnosers said they'd talked with a medical professional about what they'd found online.
Forty-one percent said that a clinician had confirmed their suspicions, and another 2% said that a clinician had partially confirmed them.
According to 18% of these people, a medical professional did not agree or offered a different opinion about the condition, and 1% said the clinician could not diagnose it.
The rest did not visit a medical professional.

]The likelihood of a consumer going online to diagnose a condition fell significantly with age: As a percentage of all U.S. adults, only 29% in the 50-64 age group and 13% in the 65+ age group did so.
However, among the 55% of Internet users who sought information about a specific disease or medical problem -- not necessarily for diagnostic reasons -- the age difference was much lower, with 43% of seniors going online for this purpose.
"Internet access drives information access," Fox said, noting that the baby boomers now moving into the ranks of seniors "are swelling the ranks of the Internet users.
If you look at the group of people 72 and older, Internet use drops precipitously.
"For the first time, the Pew survey compared the percentage of insured people to the percentage of uninsured people who went online to look up health information.
They found a difference between the percentages of people trying to diagnose an illness online, versus the percentages looking up health information in general.
"There is no statistically significant difference between those who have health insurance and those who do not when it comes to using the Internet to figure out an illness," the report found.However, 75% of insured Internet users sought any kind of health information online, compared to 59% of uninsured Internet users.
Even more striking, 60% of the insured looked up information about medical conditions, vs. 35% of the uninsured.Fox speculated that insured people are more connected to the healthcare system than the uninsured and therefore more likely to look up health information online.
But she did not draw any conclusion from the fact that just as many uninsured as insured people try to diagnose diseases on the Web, yet fewer of the uninsured visit physicians.
Other factors besides insurance may be involved, she said.
For example, some people may be using websites to look up health problems that don't require a doctor's attention.The Pew survey also found that when people did consult a physician, only 1% did so online and 8% did so both online and offline.
In contrast, Manhattan Research recently reported that 39% of physicians said they e-mailed with patients.
Fox said it's possible that some doctors may go online with a few of their patients and that some practices may just have patients fill out forms online.
But the bottom line is that "a very small group of consumers said that when they had a health issue, they could contact their doctor online," she said.On another front, the Pew report noted that 20% of Internet users had consulted online reviews of particular drugs or medical treatments, doctors, hospitals or other providers.
And just 30% of Internet users had posted online reviews of healthcare services or providers.Fsox wasn't sure why so many fewer people use or post healthcare reviews than use or post them in other fields such as travel, hospitality and consumer products.
"But it's important for people to understand that there are just a few voices that are amplified [in reviews].
That's a challenge for consumers, doctors and hospitals.
"Clinical, patient engagement, and consumer apps promise to re-energize healthcare.

Pat Quinn's failure to reform the program, which is nearly $100 billion in debt.Bob Williams, president of State Budget Solutions</ (SBS), says Illinois will be the first of many states to fail if something is not done to quell rising retirement costs for state employees and teachers.SBS, a conservative nonprofit, has studied the fiscal problems of all 50 states and sees one common denominator to curbing pension shortfalls: Converting defined-benefit retirement plans in which employees receive set benefits regardless of a state's financial health to the defined-contribution plans common in the private sector.
"The only solution is a 401(k)-type, defined-contribution system," Williams said.
"hese defined-benefit systems are underfunded woefully, and unfortunately, too many states aren't waking up to reality.
"Illinois already supplies defined contribution plans to state university employees through its TIAA-CREF program.
That retirement system is the healthiest in the state since lawmakers are forced to match employee contributions in a timely manner even as they have ignored and delayed full contributions to the defined benefit systems.Illinois has the lowest credit rating of any state and is in danger of being reduced to junk bond status because its pension liabilities are 39 percent funded .
That is less than half of what accounting professionals consider healthy.
The TIAA-CREF system, by contrast, enjoys the highest credit rating from each of the four major rating agencies.
"The higher-ed system has performed very well because members are involved directly," Williams said.
"If the legislature did not fully fund its contribution, the faculty would immediately know about it.
Whereas in a [defined-benefit] plan, they assume the money is going to there-it's obviously not.
"Williams' proposal is gaining steam among some political insiders in Illinois but reform-minded Democrats, including Gov.Quinn, are cool to the idea.
The governor has proposed a number of smaller reforms to cut back on the system's $97 billion debt to no avail.
Democrats, who hold super majorities in both legislative branches, refused to vote on his lame duck push to create a super-committee to resolve the crisis.Conservative activists from the Illinois Policy Institute, a state think tank, opposed Quinn's plan because he seemed unwilling to push for major reforms.
"It's clear that Pat Quinn does not understand the full scope of the problem.
He's just flailing around," said Jonathan Ingram, IPI's director of health policy and pension reform.
"Defined-benefit plans are outdated, virtually unheard of in private sector and for good reason.
They assume that you can predict what the [stock] market's going to look like in 30 years, what the life expectancy is going to be; there are too many variables to account for.
"Unions have fought against defined-contribution reforms, a major reason Quinn has not entertained the idea.
Anders Lindall, spokesman for the politically powerful American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, said conservatives are trying to exploit the crisis by blaming employees rather than politicians for the funding shortfall.
"They won't be happy until no worker has a defined-benefit pension," he said.
"They want everyone to have private 401(k) accounts that have failed to provide an adequate retirement savings for the American middle class.
"Defined benefit systems cut costs to taxpayers since pooled money can be managed at a cheaper cost than individual retirement accounts, according to Lindall.
The accounts also protect employees by putting their money in the hands of professional investors.The average 401(k) for households of people ages 45-54 lost about 7 percent of its value during the Great Recession, while households with younger people (ages 35-44) more prone to risky investments lost about 20 percent of their savings, according to U.S. News and World Report .Public pensions were not immune from the downturn.
The Teacher's Retirement System , the largest in the state, lost 5 percent of its value in FY 2008 followed by a 23 percent decline in 2009 before rebounding with a 13 percent gain in 2010.Ingram said the decline is indicative of the risks inherent in underfunding the system.
Illinois assumed its system would grow by 8.5 percent every year for decades.
Such optimistic assumptions allow lawmakers to pay less into the system but also force state money managers to invest in more volatile assets, such as stocks, rather than lower yielding but less risky fixed income assets.
"They're forced to reach for higher and riskier terms; there's no security," Williams said.The investment losses led Illinois to reduce its assumed rate of return to 7.75 percent in four of the state's five systems-teachers reduced their rate to 8 percent.
The lowered rates are still 22 percent higher than the average return of the best performing private sector pension systems at the start of the recession.Reformers should rely on bluntness to counteract union influence and political timidity, Williams said.
"We have to be honest with the workers and let them know that as things stand, there won't be any money left for them down the road," he said.
"There's only so much you can get from taxpayers.

Elsewhere, the American administration still has to win over nations that are reluctant to risk the economic punishment of being seen as allied with a U.S. strategy to constrain China's rise.
"If you stand still in Asia, you're going to fall behind the rise of China," said Robert S. Ross, a professor of Chinese foreign policy at Boston College.
"We're not going to stand still, but we can improve our rhetoric and disentangle from these territorial disputes.
"Obama, who's sometimes called the "first Pacific president" because of his childhood years in Indonesia and his upbringing in Hawaii, clearly has the political will to make Asia the focus of U.S. policy.
More than half of American naval assets are deployed in the region, the administration has signed fresh defense agreements with Asian partners and there's been a marked increase in high-profile U.S. state visits to promote trade and diplomacy.In November, Obama made a historic trip to the former pariah state of Myanmar, his fourth high-profile visit to Asia in as many years, and his secretaries of state and defense, Hillary Clinton and Leon Panetta, have been frequent visitors, as have numerous more junior diplomats and defense officials.
"There's no comparison," said Daniel Sneider, the associate director for research at the Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University in California, commenting on the Obama administration's approach versus that of its predecessor.
"These guys have been there.
They've thought about it more.
They have a broad strategy.
"Sneider, however, saw risk to that strategy in the pull of crises elsewhere.
"It has to be backed up by devoting real resources in the end," he said of an Asia focus.
"Any new engagement of U.S. forces in the Middle East will immediately undermine this policy.
"Even in tightly knit Washington policymaking circles, there's confusion over how to pursue this new Asia focus, starting with what to call it.A first suggestion, "forward-deployed diplomacy," was jettisoned as too militaristic, especially when it comes to prickly superpower China.
Then came "the Asia pivot," which rankled Middle Eastern and European allies, who thought it suggested abandonment of their regions.
The White House now prefers "the rebalancing," while some policymakers are starting to use the blunter "return to Asia.
"The semantics matter, analysts said, when one of the most sensitive parts of the plan includes dealing with Chinese suspicions that the maneuvering is intended to blunt China's economic and military rise.Any hope of a deeper, more complex U.S. focus on Asia, analysts who study the region say, hinges on how the second Obama administration tweaks the long-standing policy toward China that some dub "congagement," an attempt to blend containment of growing Chinese military power with engagement on trade and diplomatic issues.Justin Logan, the director of foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research center in Washington, argued in a report this month, called "China, America and the Pivot to Asia," that few are fooled that U.S. policy isn't really about containment and that the United States should step back from involving itself in "every diplomatic flare-up" so that it retains greater distance from the squabbling parties.
"If the Chinese were getting up in our face saying, 'We're putting 60 percent of our naval assets in the Caribbean and developing military alliances with Cuba and Venezuela, and none of this has anything to do with the United States,' no one would believe that," Logan said.He suggests offloading some of the security responsibilities to allied nations such as Japan, South Korea and India, and encouraging talks among those nations without U.S. officials present, let alone in the lead.
Logan said it was healthy for there to be some doubts about exactly where U.S. forces would be committed in any regional flare-up.
That would encourage nations to avoid such high-stakes disputes in the first place or to look inward for defense strategies and "help minimize free riding," as he put it.Logan's report describes two polarized camps when it comes to how the U.S. should approach China.
The hawkish policy camp, nicknamed the "dragon slayers," demands a bigger U.S. military presence in Asia to restrict China's sea access and act as a barrier to any bullying of weaker nations.At the other end of the spectrum on China policy are the analysts Logan calls "panda huggers," who are betting that a focus on trade and diplomacy over military might will force China to democratize and become a more trusted U.S. partner.The administration's current plans call for deploying 2,000 Marines to Australia and four coastal combat shipsto Singapore - hardly terrifying prospects for the Chinese, the hawks complain.But critics of the notion that the pivot lacks military chops point out that there's already a huge U.S. military presence in the Asia Pacific, larger than during the most recent Republican administrations.
There are 40,000 American troops in Japan, more than 28,000 in South Korea and 4,500 in Guam, a self-governing U.S. territory.
There are six aircraft carrier strike groups and the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which conducts regular joint military exercises with Asian allies.When the Obama administration got serious about the pivot in 2010, Boston College's Ross said, "you couldn't have asked for a more robust strategic presence than we had at the time.
"Obama has made that presence even greater, at the expense of irritating the Chinese without any appreciable strategic benefit.
That includes an increase in a U.S. military presence in South Korea that Obama ordered to reverse President George W. Bush's decision to reduce it by 40 percent - including a cut in joint military exercises, pulling troops out of the area between the demilitarized zone and Seoul, and announcing that in 2012 the U.S. would hand over wartime operational control to South Korean forces.In contrast, the Obama administration increased troop levels by 10 percent, signed four new defense agreements with South Korea, increased the size and scale of joint exercises and deferred the handover of operational control of forces until 2015.The moves, Ross said, came at a time when the presumed target of the posturing - North Korea - posed less of a threat than ever when it came to conventional warfare.
"If you're Chinese, you begin to ask yourself why this is happening, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that America's presence in South Korea is not directed at North Korea, but directed at China," Ross said.Obama's picks for secretaries of state and defense, Democrat John Kerry and Republican Chuck Hagel, have records of moderate stances toward China, which analysts say portends a policy of more engagement - not just with the Chinese, but also with other Asian powers such as Japan, India, Vietnam and South Korea.Kerry, especially, is familiar with Asia from his close involvement with the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
"I expect him to pursue an intense strategy of engagement with China, with hedging," Sneider said.
"I expect Kerry to head down a path of trying to engage the new Chinese leadership as far as they're willing to go.
"Analysts said Kerry should make it a priority to draw the U.S. back from involvement in territorial disputes over contested islands while ensuring that a more neutral stance isn't viewed as abandoning important allies.One fight is over the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands; the Chinese call them the Diaoyu Islands.
Taiwan also has staked a claim.
In December, a Chinese government airplane conducted a flyover of the disputed islands, prompting the Japanese to dispatch eight F-15 jets and an early-warning aircraft in response.The Chinese plane already was gone by then, and the situation cooled until Christmas Eve, when a Chinese coast guard Y-12 aircraft switched course to the Senkaku Islands.
Again, the Japanese launched several fighter jets and the Chinese plane left the area.
"People are watching this scrambling of jets, movements of coast guard vessels around these islands," Sneider said.
"On one hand, the U.S. is going to back the Japanese as our allies.
On the other hand, there's a message to both Japan and China to cool it.
"The other big territorial fight is over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.
They're claimed by China and several other nations: Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Vietnam.After a long-standing hands-off approach marked by American platitudes about "freedom of navigation" and "peaceful resolution," Ross said, the Obama administration jumped into the fray in 2010 by gathering the common claim-holders for talks - but notably excluding China.docno: 123883Army Advances Better Buying Power(Source: U.S Army; issued January 28, 2013)WASHINGTON --- The U.S. Army has achieved significant cost savings and cost avoidance as result of its implementation of Better Buying Power, an initiative led by the Office of the Secretary of Defense aimed at improving the management of acquisition programs, incentivizing competition, eliminating redundancy and achieving the maximum amount of savings, senior service officials explained.In place since 2010, Better Buying Power, or BBP, is also geared toward incentivizing innovation and productivity while improving the capabilities of the acquisition workforce and strengthening the tradecraft of acquisition services, among other things.
"Better Buying Power has produced large savings.
We're continuously looking to optimize the use of the Army's money," said Tom Mullins, deputy assistant secretary of the Army for Plans, Programs and Resources.Some of the key tenets of the program include specific efforts to craft and implement policies which build affordability and competitive procurement strategies into the structure of acquisition programs, said Wimpy Pybus, deputy assistant secretary of the Army for Acquisition Policy and Logistics.An integral part of the achieved savings can be directly attributed to a portion of BBP referred to as the Should-Cost/Will-Cost program; this effort encourages program managers to explore enterprising and innovative program management methods and strategies designed to gain the maximum value from dollars invested, officials said.The "Will-Cost" is the initial baseline or expected cost of a given program or technological development, whereas the "Should-Cost" is, in essence, a lower cost achieved through successful implementation of efforts designed to improve developmental efficiency.The available data from the Army's Should Cost fiscal year 2012 Closeout highlight substantial successes with the BBP program since its inception.
For instance, the Army achieved millions of dollars in savings with the procurement of the Enhanced Performance Round, by lowering the production unit cost of the M855A1/M856A1 lead-free 5.56mm ammunition.
"For years we built 5.56mm ammo with a lead core with brass wrapped around the outside.
It will have less impact on the environment than lead in the long run, lower cost material than lead and an improvement in performance of the round," Mullins explained.Finding and executing the proper contracting mechanism for each program is a considerable part of establishing greater efficiency through BBP, Mullins explained.
In fact, the Army's multi-year helicopter procurement contracts for the CH-47 Chinook and the UH-60 Black Hawk are expected to result in savings.
Multi-year contracts improve acquisition efficiency by allowing vendors to establish a stable supply and production schedule, all while securing a lower unit price, he added.
"BBP is taking a look at all of your tool kit of things you can do, and then assessing which ones are applicable to the program.
We've seen success in aviation with Black Hawk and Chinook.
The potential savings there are enormous," Mullins added.Other instances of BBP success include millions saved on programs such as Excalibur 155m artillery rounds, modifications to Abrams tank and Stryker combat vehicle procurement contracts designed to reduce costs and competitive acquisition strategies with the Counter Rocket Artillery and Mortar, or CRAM program.BBP also plays a role when it comes to the Army's Science and Technology development.
S&T influences a number of the tenants of BBP 2.0, specifically achieving affordable programs, controlling costs throughout the product lifecycle and promoting effective competition.Much of what the Army does within the S&T community can help achieve system affordability, said Mary Miller, acting deputy assistant Secretary of the Army for Research and Technology.
By designing technologies with reliability and manufacturability in mind, the Army can reduce the cost and time associated with redesign when these technologies transition from the S&T domain into formal programs of record, she said.
This results in lower developmental costs and potentially faster acquisition, she explained.By engaging program managers early in the technology development process and collaboratively defining technology, performance goals and acceptance testing, the Army can facilitate a more successful insertion of mature technology for emerging capabilities, Miller said.
"When developing new capabilities, one of the key things we need to do is make sure we reach technical maturity prior to integration.
This is an essential element of reducing risk and eliminating excess costs," Miller said.The Army, which has had great success thus far with the BBP program, is both cataloguing billions in cost savings since the program's inception while simultaneously preparing to implement the next iteration of the initiative, referred to as Better Buying Power 2.0.
"Better Buying Power is not a one-time event and you can be assured that neither is BBP 2.0, we must make it part of our culture," wrote Frank Kendall, under secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, in a Nov. 6 memorandum for the Defense acquisition workforce.
"We have more reason than ever to believe that the efficiencies we seek can be realized based on the successes we've accomplished to date.
It is imperative that we stay the course in order to deliver even greater value to our taxpayers and essential capabilities to the warfighters," he wrote in the memo.BBP 2.0 seeks to build upon and advance the core tenets of the initial BBP effort and further instill a culture of cost-consciousness, increase procurement opportunities for small business and more efficiently execute affordable acquisition programs, officials said.In addition to its many other components, BBP 2.0 is also focused on sustainment and life-cycle management, meaning program managers are encouraged to consider the entire life or span of a technology or program's maturation such that they account for its entire life cycle.BBP 2.0 also aims to build upon the initial program's emphasis upon incentivizing industry by aligning profitability with contractor performance, officials said.
They added that in fact, this effort speaks to one of DOD's broad BBP goals, which is to emphasize that the program is designed to increase productivity and by no means reduce industry profits.-ends-docno: 123889Textron, Rheinmetall and Kongsberg Announce $100 M Contract on Canadian Forces TAPV Program(Source: Textron Inc.; issued Jan. 28, 2013)Textron Systems Canada Inc., Rheinmetall Canada Inc., and Kongsberg Protech Systems (KPS) Canada today announced a $100 million CAD contract for work to be performed by KPS Canada on the Canadian Forces Tactical Armoured Patrol Vehicle (TAPV) project.
This is a sub-contract within the $205 million CAD contract between Textron Systems and Rheinmetall that was announced in October 2012.This contract will help to sustain 16 jobs and create approximately 16 more jobs - doubling the workforce at KPS Canada's London, Ontario production facility, which opened just over a year ago in November 2011.
The contract also fulfills a portion of Textron Systems' participation in Canada's Industrial and Regional Benefits (IRB) Policy arising from the government's purchase of 500 Textron TAPVs.This contract extends KPS Canada's work with the Government of Canada and strengthens the company's position as the world market leader for remotely controlled weapon stations.
Since 2005, the company has been supplying the PROTECTOR M151 Remote Weapon Stations (RWS) to the Canadian Forces.
On the TAPV project, KPS Canada will deliver a new technological innovation with the Dual Remote Weapon Station (DRWS).
This remote weapon station features two mounted weapons that can be operated by both the vehicle commander and gunner.
These capabilities provide additional safety and protection for soldiers in the field by allowing them to operate the DRWS from within the vehicle reducing their exposure to enemy fire.
"Participation in the TAPV project is of strategic importance to Kongsberg Protech Systems," said KPS Canada's President J rn Bu .
"Kongsberg Protech Systems production and participation in the TAPV program will strengthen London, Ontario as a Canadian contributor to the ground based defense industry.
KPS Canada and Kongsberg are already a large and reliable supplier in the region, the province and in Canada.
This contract has created a unique opportunity for further growth locally.
""We are extremely pleased to be working with Textron Systems and Kongsberg Protech Systems Canada," said Rheinmetall Canada's President and CEO, Dr. Andreas Knackstedt.
"Together we will deliver state of the art equipment to the Army, and provide value for taxpayers' money, while creating highly skilled jobs in Canada.
"In June 2012, the Textron TAPV Team, led by Textron Systems, was selected to manufacture 500 Canadian Forces Tactical Armoured Patrol Vehicle (TAPV) with options for up to 100 more.
The TAPV contract has a value of $603.4 million CAD, with an additional five-year in-service support contract of $105.4 million CAD.Ottawa-based Textron Systems Canada, as prime contractor, will provide overall TAPV program and configuration management, act as design authority for change management, coordinate vehicle integration activities by Canadian subcontractors, and manage the In-Service Support contract.
Textron Systems Canada will also be implementing a Canadian Industrial and Regional Benefits program designed to bring employment to Canadians and new expertise and opportunities to Canadian companies.
"Kongsberg Protech Systems Canada's DRWS is a key element in our TAPV.
As a teammate in implementing the delivery of the TAPV to the Canadian Army, they will help bring economic benefits to Canada," said Neil Rutter, general manager of Textron Systems Canada.
"In the coming months, we will continue to sign agreements with other best-in-class Canadian suppliers who will help us deliver a fleet of Textron TAPVs that provide Canadian soldiers with unmatched performance and protection for decades.
"In addition to Rheinmetall Canada and KPS Canada, the Textron TAPV team includes EODC - Engineering Office Deisenroth Canada (Ottawa, ON).The Textron TAPV is the most reliable and technologically advanced vehicle of its kind.
It draws on the company's more than 45 years of experience in the design and production of armoured vehicles.
The Textron TAPV will provide the Canadian Forces with the optimal balance of survivability, mobility and versatility, while delivering outstanding performance in the world's most challenging environments.
Extensively tested to confirm ballistic, blast, mobility and reliability levels, the Textron TAPV has been engineered to meet and exceed Canada's requirements.-ends-docno: 124351UK MoD Allots USD 84.1 Bln for Ships, Subs in Its Equipment PlanPosted on Jan 31st, 2013 with tags 84.1 , Allots , bln , equipment , its , MoD , Naval , Navy , News by topic , plan , ships , Subs , UK , USD .UK MoD Allots USD 84.1Bln for Ships, Subs in Its Equipment PlanThe Ministry of Defence has today published details of how it will equip the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force over the next 10 years and how this will be funded.For the first time, the government has set out a fully-funded Defence Equipment Plan totalling almost  160 billion.The affordability of this plan has been scrutinised by the National Audit Office (NAO) and their independent analysis is also published today.
The NAO makes clear that the MOD has:substantially revised the way it compiles and manages the equipment plan and is now approaching the task on a more prudent basis;taken difficult decisions to address what was estimated to be a  74 billion gap between its forecast funding and costs;taken significant positive steps designed to deal with the accumulated affordability gap and lay the foundations for stability going forward.And concludes that if it continues along this path: the department will be able to demonstrate it has really turned a corner.The publication of the equipment plan follows the Defence Secretary's announcement last year that the Defence Budget has been balanced for the first time in more than a decade and that the MOD is taking a new approach to financial planning.Within the equipment and equipment support budget of around  160 billion over the next ten years, Philip Hammond has introduced for the first time a contingency of  4.8 billion to manage cost variation and protect existing projects.In addition, within the  160 billion,  8 billion is currently unallocated.
This will be allocated as new equipment priorities emerge over the decade and only once the MOD is confident that they are affordable and therefore deliverable.Priorities will be decided by the Armed Forces Committee, chaired by the Chief of the Defence Staff.Structuring the Defence Equipment Plan and the budget that supports it in this way will enable the MOD to deliver Future Force 2020.The equipment plan includes the following major investments in state-of-the-art military capabilities and their support over the next ten years:35.8 billion on submarines and the deterrent, including a total of seven Astute Class attack submarines and developing a replacement for Vanguard Class ballistic missile submarines18.5 billion on combat air, including Lightning II and Typhoon fast jets and unmanned aerial vehicles;17.4 billion on ships, including Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers, six new Type 45 destroyers and the development of the Type 26 Global Combat Ship;13.9 billion on aircraft for air-to-air refuelling, passenger and heavy lift, such as Voyager and A400M;12.3 billion on armoured fighting vehicles, including Warrior, Scout and other land equipment;12.1 billion on helicopters, including Chinook, Apache, Puma and Wildcat; and11.4 billion on weapons, for example, missiles, torpedoes and precision guided bombs.The Defence Equipment Plan gives the defence industry more information than ever before about the MOD's priorities to enable them to invest in the capabilities the military will require.Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:"It is essential that our forces are fully equipped to respond to the range of threats we face in this uncertain world.
This  160 billion equipment plan will ensure the UK's Armed Forces remain among the most capable and best equipped in the world, providing the military with the confidence that the equipment they need is fully funded.For the first time in a generation the Armed Forces will have a sustainable equipment plan.Step by step, we are clearing up the culture of over-promising and under-delivering that created a multi-billion pound black hole in the Defence Budget.
Today's NAO report confirms that we were right to take the difficult decisions to cut unaffordable expenditure and balance the books.
"Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richard s, said:"Successful operations rely on a proper equipment programme based on sustained funding into the future.
Through the Armed Forces Committee to the Defence Board, all 3 Services now have greater input and more certainty than ever before about what equipment they will have and when.The clarity provided by the equipment plan builds on the confidence in the budget and shows that Future Force 2020 is affordable and achievable.
Our Armed Forces will have the capabilities to respond to global threats and provide the nation's defence.

Frank Wolf (R-Va. ), chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds the U.S. space agency, that they support his panel's approach to commercial crew vehicle development.
"It seems unlikely that NASA will receive significant budgetary relief in the foreseeable future," the three retired astronauts wrote in a May 4 letter to Wolf.
"Consequently, it is mandatory to maximize return on the limited funds available to access low Earth orbit.
An early downselect would seem to be prudent in order to maximize the possibility of developing a crew-carrying spacecraft in time to be operationally useful.
"House members are scheduled to debate the Wolf panel's response to NASA 's fiscal 2013 budget request on Tuesday.
Report language accompanying the Wolf bill, which was approved by the full House Appropriations Committee, calls for "an immediate downselect to a single competitor or, at most, the execution of a leader-follower paradigm in which NASA makes one large award to a main commercial partner and a second small award to a backup partner "NASA prefers to maintain competition among companies vying for funds under its commercial crew development (CCDev) seed-money effort as long as possible, in the belief that it will ultimately cost less to develop a vehicle that way.
Under pressure from some of the CCDev competitors the agency also opted to continue the program under Space Act Agreements, rather than using the more restrictive Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) approach.Wolf 's panel argued that a quick downselect would allow NASA to move back to the FAR procurement approach and avoid a complicated transition from funding more than one company under the Space Act to a FAR procurement.
The three Apollo commanders , who earlier urged Congress to resist White House plans to hand off human access to the private sector, agreed that a Space Act procurement "would be unlikely to provide the documentation that we normally depend upon to provide high confidence in reaching our technical goals.
""We all agree that our country has painted itself into a corner and does not now, nor will for many years, have a U.S. government craft suitable for carrying cargo or crew to the International Space Station," the astronauts wrote.
"The reputation of our country and the potential liability associated with carrying United States and international crews to and from the ISS dictates that we do everything possible to ensure that any commercial crew service meets standards equal to those that we would enforce would the craft be government owned and operated.
"docno: 126402Remarks at the 7th Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention Review ConferenceRemarksHillary Rodham ClintonSecretary of StatePalais des NationsGeneva, SwitzerlandDecember 7, 2011ShareThank you, Mr. President.
And I would also like to express my appreciation to all of the delegates and to my colleague, Minister Rosenthal, for his comments.
I want to thank the Implementation Support Unit for all the efforts to advance the work here.I want to start by acknowledging that our countries have accomplished a great deal together under the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.
One hundred sixty-five states have now committed not to pursue these weapons, and I am delighted to welcome Burundi and Mozambique to the Convention, and I join in urging all states who have not yet done so to join.President Obama has made it a top goal of his Administration to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction, because we view the risk of a bioweapons attack as both a serious national security challenge and a foreign policy priority.
In an age when people and diseases cross borders with growing ease, bioweapons are a transnational threat, and therefore we must protect against them with transnational action.The nature of the problem is evolving.
The advances in science and technology make it possible to both prevent and cure more diseases, but also easier for states and non-state actors to develop biological weapons.
A crude, but effective, terrorist weapon can be made by using a small sample of any number of widely available pathogens, inexpensive equipment, and college-level chemistry and biology.
Even as it becomes easier to develop these weapons, it remains extremely difficult - as you know - to detect them, because almost any biological research can serve dual purposes.
The same equipment and technical knowledge used for legitimate research to save lives can also be used to manufacture deadly diseases.So of course, we must continue our work to prevent states from acquiring biological weapons.
And one of the unsung successes of the Convention is that it has engrained a norm among states against biological weapons.
Even countries that have never joined the Convention no longer claim that acquiring such weapons is a legitimate goal.
But unfortunately, the ability of terrorists and other non-state actors to develop and use these weapons is growing.
And therefore, this must be a renewed focus of our efforts during the next 14 days, as well as the months and years ahead.Now, I know there are some in the international community who have their doubts about the odds of a mass biological attack or major outbreak.
They point out that we have not seen either so far, and conclude the risk must be low.
But that is not the conclusion of the United States, because there are warning signs, and they are too serious to ignore.Terrorist groups have made it known they would want to acquire and use these weapons.
And in the 1990s, the apocalyptic cult, Aum Shinrikyo unleashed two attacks in Tokyo by spraying a liquid containing anthrax spores into the air and unleashing sarin gas into the subway.
In 2001, we found evidence in Afghanistan that al-Qaida was seeking the ability to conduct bioweapons attacks.
And less than a year ago, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula made a call to arms for - and I quote - "brothers with degrees in microbiology or chemistry to develop a weapon of mass destruction.
"We all have an interest in ramping up our efforts to prevent outbreaks and attacks and then to be prepared to respond if they do occur.
The 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States killed five people and sickened 17.
More than 10,000 were required to go on to antibiotics.
A mass outbreak could cripple an already fragile global economy by cutting off the movement of people, goods, and sparking food shortages.
And of course, a victim of an attack could just as easily travel from one country to another.So shoring up our domestic and international defenses will make it easier to detect and respond.
We need public health systems that can quickly diagnose outbreaks, whatever their source, and mobilize the right medical resources and personnel.
By making any one country more secure, we make the international community more secure at the same time.Two years ago, the Obama Administration released our national strategy for countering biological threats, which is a whole-of-government approach designed to protect the American people and improve our global capacity.
We support our partners' efforts to meet new international standards in disease preparedness, detection, and response.
We are helping make laboratories safer and more secure, engaging 44 countries in these efforts this year.
And since 2007, we've conducted more than a dozen workshops to help train public health and law enforcement officials.But there is still more to do, and I want to briefly mention three areas.
First, we need to bolster international confidence that all countries are living up to our obligations under the Convention.
It is not possible, in our opinion, to create a verification regime that will achieve this goal.
But we must take other steps.
To begin with, we should revise the Convention's annual reporting systems to ensure that each party is answering the right questions, such as what we are each all doing to guard against the misuse of biological materials.Countries should also take their own measures to demonstrate transparency.
Under our new Bio-Transparency and Openness Initiative, we will host an international forum on health and security to exchange views on biological threats and discuss the evolution of U.S. bioresearch programs.
We will underscore that commitment by inviting a few state parties to the Convention to tour a U.S. biodefense facility next year, as Ambassador van den IJssel and the UN 1540 Committee did this past summer.
And we will promote dialogue through exchanges among scientists from the United States and elsewhere.
In short, we are intending and our meeting our obligation to the full letter and spirit of the treaty, and we wish to work with other nations to do so as well.Second, we must strengthen each country's ability to detect and respond to outbreaks and improve international coordination.
As President Obama said earlier this year at the UN, "We must come together to prevent and detect and fight every kind of biological danger, whether it's a pandemic like H1N1, or a terrorist threat, or a terrible disease. "
Five years ago, 194 countries came together at the World Health Organization and committed to build our core capacities by June 2012, and we should redouble our efforts to meet that goal.
We will support the WHO in this area, and I urge others to join us.Finally, we need thoughtful international dialogue about the ways to maximize the benefits of scientific research and minimize the risks.
For example, the emerging gene synthesis industry is making genetic material widely available.
This obviously has many benefits for research, but it could also potentially be used to assemble the components of a deadly organism.
So how do we balance the need for scientific freedom and innovation with the necessity of guarding against such risksThere is no easy answer, but it begins with open conversations among governments, the scientific community, and other stakeholders, in this forum and elsewhere.
We have recently had our U.S. President's Commission on Bioethics develop ethical principles that could be helpful in this dialogue, and we urge a discussion about them.
Ambassador Kennedy and the U.S. team look forward to working with all of you for a strong set of recommendations.And let me conclude by saying we know the biological threats we face today are new, but our commitment to face threats together is not.
More than 85 years ago, after the horrors of World War I, the international community took a stand against the use of poison gases and bacteriological weapons.
And nearly a half-century later, that shared commitment brought us together to adopt the Biological Weapons Convention.
So in that same spirit, let us move forward to address the challenges we face together in the 21 st century.Thank you very much.PRN: 2011/T57-19docno: 126678New waterjets could propel LCS to greater speeds14:53, Technology/EngineeringFull size imageThe Navy's fifth Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), Milwaukee, will be the first to benefit from new high-power density waterjets aimed at staving off rudder and propeller damage experienced on high-speed ships.The product of an Office of Naval Research (ONR) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) program, the waterjets arrived last month at the Marinette Marine shipyard in Wisconsin, where Milwaukee (LCS 5) is under construction.
"We believe these waterjets are the future," said Dr. Ki-Han Kim, program manager in ONR's Ship Systems and Engineering Research Division.
"Anything that we can do to keep ships ready to go will ultimately benefit our warfighters.
"Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jonathan Greenert's 2013-2017 Navigation Plan calls for fielding improved ships to support counterterrorism and irregular warfare missions at sea and ashore.
The LCS will play a big role in the Navy's plan as a modular, adaptable vessel for use against diesel submarines, littoral mines and attacks by small surface craft.Developed by Rolls-Royce Naval Marine in Walpole, Mass., in collaboration with ONR and Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, the new Axial-Flow Waterjet Mk-1 can move nearly half a million gallons of seawater per minute, providing more thrust per unit than current commercial waterjets.
Four of the new waterjets will propel the LCS to speeds greater than 40 knots.Researchers believe the smaller, more efficient waterjets will help the LCS avoid excessive maintenance costs associated with cavitationa  a phenomenon that occurs when changes in pressure create air bubbles on rotating machinery, such as marine propellers.
Repeated occurrences can cause whole chunks of metal to wear away, leading to frequent repairs and replacements.The waterjets' new design could increase their lifespan between repairs.The FNC program that oversaw development of this technology proved to be as adaptable as LCS.
The waterjets originally were slated to benefit another ship program that was discontinued.
Instead of cancelling the waterjets program, officials regrouped and shifted their focus to designing a product that would improve the performance of LCS.ONR's FNC program saves taxpayer money by streamlining processes to deliver cutting-edge products within five years.
The waterjets project began in 2007, and the delivery last month to the shipyard marked its successful completion.Next up for the waterjets will be full-scale sea trials on Milwaukee (LCS 5), expected to occur in the next 24 months.Eventually, the waterjets could end up on 10 LCS under contract to be built by Lockheed Martin.Provided by Office of Naval Researchdocno: 12686Space, Nuclear Weapons, and Ballistic Missile Defense - The New TriadMay 8, 2012 ::  The Heritage Foundation  ::In April, the Independent Working Group (IWG) on Missile Defense and the Space Relationship held an event on the new triad-space, nuclear weapons, and ballistic missile defense-and its importance for the United States.
It explored the fundamental importance and the relationship among the different elements of defense.
The United States currently does not have a strategy that would integrate these elements in a synergistic manner.Robert Butterworth, president of Aries Analytics, pointed out that the intelligence community developed the military space systems the United States operates today.
That community, however, has fundamentally different interests than the military.
The United States needs to better articulate and determine what U.S. future military capabilities will be and what space systems would best address their requirements.
U.S. nuclear policy suffers from a similar lack of coherent vision, which makes the recent push for yet another round of nuclear reductions questionable.
The current guidance is full of contradictions: The U.S. has a plan for new delivery vehicles, but it must use old nuclear warheads and cannot test them.Keith Payne, president of the National Institute for Public Policy and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Forces Policy, noted that according to the Nuclear Posture Review, President Obama's top goal is nonproliferation.
The Administration assumes that missile defenses work against this goal by discouraging future reductions (note Russia's recent threats of a preemptive strike if the U.S. deploys its missile defenses to Europe).
This leads to an irreconcilable tension between a drive to "nuclear zero"-a world without nuclear weapons-and missile defense, plus the need to sustain nuclear forces.
In addition, with fewer nuclear weapons, the Administration would be required to move toward counter-value targets (training missiles at an adversary's populations).
This approach, rejected for more than five decades, has been considered immoral and illegal.
Resilience and adaptability, necessary to adapt to future threats and assure allies, are lost when the U.S. has a lower nuclear capability.Ambassador Henry Cooper, former director of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, emphasized that the United States will not move to the most effective and cost-efficient interceptors in space without strong presidential leadership.
Such leadership is lacking in the Obama Administration.
While the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is gone, limits on the missile defense program remain.
For example, so far the successive Administrations since the withdrawal from the treaty have not taken steps to make Aegis capable of countering short-range as well as intermediate-range ballistic missiles.
In addition, the Aegis program can be accelerated to give it the ability to counter long-range missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles.Rob Soofer, the Strategic Forces Policy Advisor for Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ), provided a congressional perspective by mentioning three issues that are a priority for the GOP leadership.
First, the Administration's commitment to the nuclear weapons complex is fading, as the President's defense budget request this year is below what the Administration agreed to provide in concurrence with the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START).
A loss of scientists without nuclear weapons design experience is equally concerning.
Second, reductions below the New START level will not be possible unless the Administration provides funding for nuclear modernization.
Third, while the Administration emphasized regional missile defense, Republicans in Congress would like to see more resources invested in homeland defense.

24, 2012 - 03:43PM   |By PIERRE TRAN   |Filed UnderWorld NewsEuropeParis - Defense procurement chiefs have signed key cooperation agreements on the Watchkeeper tactical UAV and a joint 13 million euro ($15.7 million) research study on a future unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), British and French defense ministers said July 24 in a joint statement.However, a meeting between French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and his British counterpart, Philip Hammond, failed to yield an announcement on collaboration on an Anglo-French medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) UAV.BAE Systems and Dassault Aviation will take the lead on the UCAV work.
The next few days should also see an announcement linking Rolls-Royce and Safran in a joint study for future engine options, industry executives said.The British and a French-led consortium already have separate UCAV technology demonstrators scheduled to fly for the first time next year.
Both vehicles rely on the aging Adour engine.Le Drian met Hammond in London on his first official visit to the British capital since the new French socialist administration was formed in June.
The ministers "committed to strengthen their defense relations and particularly welcomed the signing of two important memoranda of understanding by Peter Luff, British minister for defense equipment, support and technology, and Laurent Collet-Billon, director of the Direction Armement, marking a new step in Anglo-French cooperation in UAVs," a joint statement said.On the Watchkeeper, France is acquiring one system from the U.K. to conduct tests and operational studies, expected to last to mid-2013, which may lead to a future French Army acquisition, a defense official said.The Watchkeeper system is built by Thales UK and based on the Israeli Elbit Hermes 450.Talks were also held on cooperation between military specialist units equipped with the same drones, the statement said.Thales has started delivery of the Watchkeeper to the British Army but the system's deployment to Afghanistan is being stalled by military certification and other issues.On the UCAV, BAE and Dassault will conduct studies in a demonstration preparation program, expected to last 12 to 15 months, to identify key technologies for a future aerial weapon system intended for 2030-2040, the official said.London and Paris will share equally the 13 million-euro cost of the UCAV study.France is conducting a policy review on the MALE UAV segment, which is expected to take a few more weeks, the official said.
That national review will have consequences for any cooperation with Britain.French military needs and budgetary constraints are the main factors in that review, which suspended a previous decision to acquire as an intermediate solution the Heron TP from Dassault and Israel Aerospace Industries.The national review gives time to explore ways of bringing Germany into a cooperative MALE UAV program, which would allow EADS to join the international effort.
The review is understood to include the Predator B, or Reaper MQ-9, from General Atomics.The Defense Ministry is in talks for an extension of the contract for the Harfang MALE UAV system, due to expire in October 2013, an industry executive has said.French officials see the UAV announcements as revitalizing the Anglo-French Lancaster House treaty on bilateral defense cooperation.
Beyond that cross-Channel collaboration, Le Drian's visit to London is also part of France's attempt to renew efforts to boost a common European defense.Le Drian was in Warsaw July 23, in Berlin June 22, and had a visit here from his Italian counterpart on June 18, all within two months of the formation of the new administration.French officials see those capitals and ministers as the first circle in Europe for defense partners.The previous French administration had announced a plan to acquire the Heron TP as an intermediate solution but Le Drian suspended that decision when he took up the defense portfolio.Hammond and Le Drian also noted the progress made in nuclear cooperation and welcomed the work done in the setting up of a combined joint expeditionary force and the Corsican Lion exercise scheduled for October, the statement said.A next bilateral meeting will be held in France.docno: 427746US Document Riles Critics of Proposed Canadian F-35 BuyNov.
16, 2014 - 02:51PM   |By DAVID PUGLIESE   |A leaked US document has put the Canadian government under fire over the proposed F-35 purchase.
(Lockheed Martin)Filed UnderWorld NewsNorth AmericaVICTORIA, BRITISH COLUMBIA - A leaked US document has raised new questions about Canada's involvement in the F-35 program and given critics of the fighter jet as well as opposition members of Parliament new ammunition to accuse the Canadian government of misleading the public about the proposed acquisition.An Oct. 27 briefing by US Air Force Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, F-35 Program Executive Office director, outlined how Canada intends to initially purchase four F-35s.
That flies in the face of continued Canadian government assurances that no decision had been made about whether the country would buy the aircraft.Defense News has seen a copy of the document.Canada's Conservative Party government originally committed in 2010 to purchasing 65 F-35s, but the acquisition soon became a major political albatross around the neck of Prime Minister Stephen Harper.Opposition Parliament members alleged his government misled Canadians about the F-35's price and performance.In April 2012, Auditor General Michael Ferguson found that Department of National Defence officials withheld key information from Parliament about the jet, underesti-mated costs and didn't follow proper procurement rules.The government, under continuing fire about the increasing cost of the F-35s, announced in December 2012 it would put the procurement on a temporary hold and examine other aircraft.
That process is ongoing, government ministers said.But Bogdan's briefing to US Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James undercuts those claims.
Bogdan pointed out that Canada wants to "swap" four aircraft destined for the US Air Force and receive those as early as 2015.The aircraft would be replaced at a later date by Canada.Bogdan noted in the 14-page briefing deck that the US Air Force agrees with the plan as long as the F-35 initial operating capability date of 2016 remains on schedule and no other allies make similar requests.For the swap to happen, Canada needs to deliver a letter of intent to the F-35 project engineering office this month, the briefing points out.
Congress would also have to be notified.Kyra Hawn, spokeswoman for the F-35 Joint Program Office, said the "briefing was for official use only.
It was to inform future decisions regarding Canada's F-35 acquisition.
We will not be commenting any further on the content of the slides.
"Lockheed Martin spokesman Mike Barton referred questions to Canada's Public Works Department "as these would be government-to-government type discussions and nothing we would be privy to.
"Marcel Poulin, press secretary for Public Works Minister Diane Finley, said, "No decision has been made on the replacement of Canada's CF-18 fleet.
"He did not explain why Bogdan was informing James about Canada's decision to proceed with the F-35 if the Canadian government still had not made a decision on purchasing the aircraft.But analysts and opposition MPs are pointing to Bogdan's briefing as a smoking gun that proves the Conservative Party government has been misleading Parliament and the Canadian public.
"Getting into the production line this fiscal year is clearly an intention to go ahead and buy those planes," said Jack Harris, defense critic with the official opposition New Democratic Party.He noted that the Bogdan briefing proves the Canadian government is "going behind the backs of Canadians" and that it plans to move ahead with the acquisition despite continuing concerns about the F-35 and its costs.
"[The public is] just being deceived by this government taking action without the kind of transparency that's required, without the proper debate, without notifying Canadians, without notifying Parliament," Harris added.Alan Williams, the former Canadian defense procurement chief, said the information contained in Bogdan's briefing raises questions about the government's claims it is examining other aircraft besides the F-35 to replace the CF-18s.
"The government claims about a fair and transparent process are called into question," Williams said.Some Canadian aerospace industry representatives and political analysts, such as Michael Byers of the University of British Columbia, see the move as designed to quickly lock the country into an F-35 purchase before any competition could be considered.Industry representatives said the move was clumsy, destined to fail and will only provide further ammunition for F-35 critics.Canada is still an official partner in the F-35 program and has not informed the US government or Lockheed Martin of any plans to change that.
Canada operates 78 CF-18 fighter aircraft.
It was originally planning to replace those with the conventional take-off and landing version of the F-35.In the meantime, the Canadian government has ordered a modernization program for the CF-18s to keep them flying until 2025.Johanna Quinney, spokeswoman for Defence Minister Rob Nicholson, said the modernization project is expected to start in 2016 and be completed in 2019.The program will include replacement of some flight controls, as well as structural and avionics upgrades.
Core CF-18 avionics systems will also need to be augmented to provide secure communi-cations between the CF-18 and allied units, Quinney said.
The aircraft's software will also be modernized and simulators will be upgraded.All content   2014, Gannett Government Media Corporationdocno: 428460November 18, 2014New Orleans Becomes Home to Fastest Internet Hub in the WorldNEW ORLEANS, La.
, Nov. 18 - SCinet, the undisputed fastest computer network in the world, is now live!
Beginning Sunday, November 16, the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center became home to the fastest and most innovative computer network, delivering more than 1.3 trillion bits per second (terabits per second!)
of network bandwidth to the Supercomputing Conference (SC14) from around the world.
"By building the fastest, most innovative operational network possible every year, SCinet gives the SC conference attendees a unique chance to showcase and discover the latest research in HPC," says Kate Petersen Mace, Director of External Partnership Management at Clemson University and SC14's SCinet Chair.
"SCinet enables data-intensive research and live use of high performing hardware to run multi-gigabit demonstrations, requiring a fast and robust infrastructure.
We start planning for SCinet well over a year in advance of the conference, with input from the HPC community.
This ensures the network will support the technical needs and challenge volunteers while operating the latest vendor-provided equipment.
I'm very excited to see how our attendees make use of our SC14 resources.
"SCinet is built by a team of expert volunteers from around the world, taking one year to design the network, three weeks to set it up, four days to operate it, and twenty-four hours to tear it down.
Over 100 engineers from industry, academia and government institutions came together to build this network, using over $18 million in loaned equipment and over 80 miles of newly installed fiber optic cable lines in the convention center.This year, SCinet has connected multiple circuits, resulting in an unprecedented bandwidth of 1.3 terabits per second, in collaboration with leading national and international research networks and commodity providers.
SCinet partnered with the Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (LONI) Network, who received extra support from The Louisiana Board of Regents, to deliver the unprecedented bandwidth into New Orleans.In addition to the massive external capacity SCinet will bring to the convention center, the network is also supporting research initiatives through a half-day workshop, "Innovating the Network for Data-Intensive Science," which provides a unique opportunity for network researchers to showcase research on emerging topics such as software-defined networking and application-based data transfers.
This new workshop includes a demonstration track and a technical papers track dedicated to high performance networking technologies, protocols, hardware, etc.Further, SCinet is providing more than 11,000 expected conference attendees with wireless connectivity throughout the conference areas.
The SCinet team built the SC14 wireless network using more than 180 wireless access points to support more than 4000 simultaneous users on the conference wifi.
The wireless network will include support for Eduroam (education roaming) service, which allows users (researchers, teachers, students, and staff) from participating institutions to securely access the protected wireless network using their home organization's login credentials.SCinet is the result of the hard work and significant contributions of many government, research, education and corporate collaborators who have volunteered time, equipment and expertise to ensure SC14's success.

"For better or worse, the process of decommissioning of nuclear facilities from service is happening for the first time in Bulgaria.
I will not hide the fact that it was not easy to meet NRA's requirements for this activity," Petrov said.Difficulties in preparing for the licences included structural changes at SE RAW Kozloduy in order to meet the requirements of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which finances the salaries of the Bulgarian company's employees, he added.During European Union accession negotiations with the European Commission, Bulgaria committed to closing units 1 and 2 of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant by the end of 2002 and units 3 and 4 by the end of 2006.
All four units are V-230 model VVER-440 reactors, which the EC had earlier classified as non-upgradable.
However, units 3 and 4 were of an improved design and closer to the later V-213 design than any others of their class.In addition to the national decommissioning fund, in June 2001 the Kozloduy International Decommissioning Support Fund was established at the EBRD to finance decommissioning activities of Kozloduy 1-4 as well as to support energy projects in the country.NRA transferred the licences for units 1 and 2 to in October 2010, in anticipation of decommissioning work.Westinghouse said in August it plans to hold a competitive tender "within the next year" for construction of a seventh reactor at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant.
The AP1000 reactor is projected to be online by 2023.
The site is already home to two operating Russian-designed VVER-1000 pressurised water reactors, Kozloduy 5 and 6, as well as the four shut-down VVER-440s.Westinghouse, part of Japan's Toshiba group, announced the target date following its signing of a shareholder agreement for the Kozloduy nuclear power plant expansion project.
A source close to the talks in Sofia told World Nuclear News the agreement decides the ownership of project company Kozloduy NPP - New Builds plc, of which Kozloduy NPP plc and Westinghouse will own, respectively, 70% and 30%.Researched and writtenby World Nuclear NewsRelated StoriesWestinghouse moves forward with Kozloduy 7WNA LinksKozloduy 1Kozloduy 2Decommissioning Nuclear FacilitiesNuclear Power in BulgariaRelated LinksBulgarian Energy Holding (BEH)European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)Kozloduy NPPFiled under: Plant licensing , Decommissioning , Bulgariadocno: 434625News | December 1, 2014Freescale RF Power GaN Transistor Delivers Breakthrough Wideband And Thermal PerformanceAUSTIN, TEXAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Freescale Semiconductor (NYSE: FSL), the global leader in radio frequency (RF) power transistors , today introduced the industry's highest thermal and wideband performance GaN device with a 125 watts continuous wave (CW) GaN-on-SiC transistor.

Megaports Program Operational in MexicoJuly 26, 2012A U.S. program to deploy radiation detectors at key shipping hubs around the world is now up and running in neighboring Mexico, the Spanish news agency EFE reported on Wednesday (see GSN , Oct. 5, 2011).The National Nuclear Security Administration's Megaports Initiative, which is aimed at detecting the illicit shipment of potential nuclear and radiological weapons materials, is now active at Mexico's four chief seaports, according to a press release from the U.S. Embassy in the Mexican capital.Both stationary and movable radiation monitors have been put in place at ports in Altamira, Lazaro Cardenas, Manzanillo and Veracruz.
Approximately 92 percent of the nation's shipping containers move through the four shipping hubs.
Work on the effort began in 2007 and management of the technology was formally handed over to Mexican authorities on Tuesday.
"The inauguration of the Megaports in these four cities is an illustration of Mexico's overall commitment to modernize its import and export management system over recent years, and to address its responsibilities under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, which calls on member states to take specific actions to prevent the proliferation of controlled materials and equipment and prevent non-state actors from acquiring weapons of mass destruction," according to U.S. Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Laura Dogu.The successful institution of the anti-nuclear trafficking effort "is also an illustration of the continuing close cooperation between the United States and Mexico to make our shared landmass safer and more secure for the citizens of both countries," Dogu stated (EFE/ Fox News , July 25).TagsCounterproliferation, Nuclear ,Nuclear Smuggling and Materials TraffickingRelated GSN StoriesMultinational Counterproliferation Drill to be Held in JapanTurkey Confiscates Potential Radiological "Dirty Bomb" SubstanceCIA Opens Counterproliferation CenterSouth Korea to Conduct Anti-WMD ExercisesColombia Joins Proliferation Security Initiativedocno: 438675 Missile ThreatA Project of the George C.

"Scientific experiments carried out by China within its borders are normal ones conducted according to its schedule and they are not directed against any specific country or target," the Chinese Ministry of National Defense said in a response to US media report which mentioned the test of a new hypersonic missile in western China on December 2.In a statement on its website, the Ministry referred to The Washington Free Beacon report stating that the third flight test, following two in January and August, was part of China's "strategic nuclear program and efforts to develop delivery vehicles capable of defeating US countermeasures".Reports in August said the second test of a hypersonic vehicle in its attempts to find a way to deliver nuclear weapons at immense speed to evade defence systems was not successful.The test was carried out on August 7 at a missile and satellite launching centre in Shanxi province, about 300 kilometres from its capital Taiyuan.The vehicle reportedly broke up soon after it was launched.The first test took place on January 9, and it was confirmed by the National Defence Ministry as successful a few days later, according to reports in the Hong Kong Media.The latest model is designed to be carried by a ballistic missile to an undisclosed suborbital altitude, then released.The vehicle then dives towards its target at speeds of up to Mach 10, more than 12,000 kilometres per hour.The United States is the only other nation known to have developed similar technology.
Russia and India are also known to be developing similar vehicles.Several of the Chinese military experts while commenting on the missile test in August said the Hypersonic missile could render a number of US defence systems useless.This entry was posted in News and tagged hypersonic missile , People's Republic of China (PRC) , Ballistic Missile Defense (Foreign) , Testing - Foreign by editor .

High-Energy Innovation is the second of three reports in the Climate Pragmatism project, a partnership of Arizona State University's Consortium for Science, Policy, and Outcomes and The Breakthrough Institute.High-Energy Innovation evaluates four clean energy technologies - shale gas, carbon capture and storage, nuclear, and solar - and finds that, in all cases, industrializing countries are making significant investments and leveraging international collaborations in order to make energy cleaner, cheaper and more reliable.Nearly all of the growth in energy markets and the majority of new energy technologies deployed in the next several decades are projected to occur in the developing world.
"It is [in non-OECD countries] that we should expect to see - and should work hardest to accelerate - energy innovation," write the authors.
Among the report's authors are Gary Dirks, director of ASU's Global Institute of Sustainability, and consortium co-director Daniel Sarewitz.Through a series of detailed maps, High-Energy Innovation charts energy innovation in shale gas, carbon capture and storage, nuclear, and solar currently underway worldwide.
By leveraging high-growth markets in support of advancing important clean energy technologies, the report argues that this globalized "high-energy innovation" offers the most pragmatic path toward modernity in emerging economies and the best chance to develop and scale cheap, clean, abundant energy in all nations.More information: The report is available online: http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/issues/innovation-policy/high-energy-innovationProvided by Arizona State University--------------------------------------------------------------------------------docno: 439856 The Department of the Navy's Information Technology MagazineNavy Moving Forward With LCSBy Office of the Secretary of the Navy - December 11, 2014WASHINGTON (NNS) -- Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has directed the Navy "to move forward with a multi-mission small surface combatant based on modified Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) hull designs.
"Consistent with the Fleet's views on the most valued capabilities delivered by a small surface combatant, the modified LCS ship will be more lethal and survivable.
It will provide multi-mission anti-surface warfare (SUW) and anti-submarine warfare capabilities (ASW), as well as continuous and effective air, surface and underwater self-defense.
Adding to current LCS Flight 0+ baseline configurations, which include the 57mm gun and SeaRAM missile system, this ship will be equipped with over-the-horizon surface-to-surface missiles, air defense upgrades (sensors and weapons), an advanced electronic warfare system; advanced decoys; a towed array system for submarine detection and torpedo defense, two 25mm guns, an armed helicopter capable of engaging with either Hellfire missiles or MK-54 torpedoes, and an unmanned FireScout helicopter for surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting.Modularity design features will also be retained to augment SUW and ASW capabilities as directed by the Fleet Commanders.
Available mission modules include Longbow Surface to-Surface Missiles (Hellfire), two MK46 30mm guns, and two 11M RHIBs for Surface Warfare, or a variable depth sonar for submarine warfare which, when added to the ship's organic multi-function towed array and embarked helicopter, make this an extremely effective anti-submarine warfare platform.In addition to the improved weapon systems capabilities for this ship, which reduce its susceptibility to being hit by a threat weapon, the small surface combatant will also include improved passive measures - measures that will reduce the ship's signature against mine threats, and measures that will harden certain vital spaces and systems against potential damage caused by weapon impact - to further enhance its overall survivability.From an operational perspective, the sum of these improvements will increase the ship's capability and availability to participate in SUW Surface Action Groups, ASW Search and Attack Units; escort of High Value Units, and support of Carrier Strike Group (CSG) SUW and ASW operations.With increased lethality and survivability, the modified LCS will provide the flexibility to operate both independently and as a part of an aggregated force.
This decision allows the Navy to add organic multi-mission capabilities to the small surface combatant force while leveraging the benefits and affordability of the LCS program.
The modified LCS ships will complement the planned 32 LCS ships, resulting in a 52 ship Small Surface Combatant Fleet in keeping with the Navy's Force Structure Analysis.
The 32 LCS ships, with their full modular capability, will allow the Navy to deploy assets to meet the Navy's mine warfare, SUW, and ASW demands.For more Navy news go to: Navy News Service .TAGS: Cybersecurity , Spectrum , Telecommunications , Wireless , WorkforceSANTA RITA, Guam (Dec. 11, 2014) The littoral combat ship USS Fort Worth (LCS 3) is moored at Apra Harbor on U.S.

The automated process will be used to make canopies-the transparent shells around the cockpits-for more than 2,000 aircraft, saving as much as $125 million over the life of the F-35 program.ONR ManTech led a team of military and industry scientists and engineers in automating the thermoforming process used to create F-35 canopies, saving time and money and eliminating potential hazards for human work crews.
"This award confirms our commitment to developing the most efficient and cost-effective ways to manufacture some of the most critical hardware our Sailors and Marines use," said John Carney, director of ONR's ManTech program.The automation project began in 2011 and cost just $1.3 million.
Much of the work was carried out at the Composites Manufacturing Technology Center , one of seven centers of excellence under ONR's ManTech program.
"The potential cost savings represent a huge return on a relatively small initial investment by ONR," said Neil Graf, Program Officer for ONR ManTech.The F-35 canopy represents the cutting edge in aircraft design.
Its unique shape and specialized material the make the canopy manufacturing process more complex than that for other aircraft.Currently, skilled technicians load an acrylic shell into a forming tool and load the assembly into an oven heated to 200 degrees where the canopy forms over a span of up to six days.
During that time, workers regularly enter the oven to makes observations and manually adjust positioning clamps to control the forming process.The new method uses a control system with cameras to see inside the oven to calculate the rate at which the canopy's shape is forming.
The clamps automatically adjust to ensure the shape remains uniform throughout the process to meet the F-35's stringent requirements.The new system gets the job done in just two or three days.
It also requires fewer tools and oven time and less clean-up afterwards.
Most importantly, workers no longer have to enter the hot ovens.The automated thermoforming process underscores the Chief of Naval Operations'  Navigation Plan that calls for the service to continue efforts to make investments to address near-term challenges and develop future capabilities even in the face of budget constraints.ONR ManTech partnered with experts from the F-35 Program Office, Naval Air Systems Command, GKN Aerospace Transparency Systems and Penn State's Applied Research Laboratory to develop the automated system.GKN Aerospace Transparency Systems, in coordination with the F-35 Program Office, plans to implement the new process in May 2015.Eric Beidel is a contractor in ONR's Corporate Strategic Communications department.About the Office of Naval ResearchThe Department of the Navy's Office of Naval Research (ONR) provides the science and technology necessary to maintain the Navy and Marine Corps' technological advantage.

"
The most important being the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which the U.S. accuses Russia of violating by flight testing a new cruise missile.--"Despite the dispute, it would be a huge mistake for the United States to withdraw from the I.N.F.treaty, as some congressmen have demanded.
That would remove all restraints on Russia and seriously weaken a system of treaties that has been remarkably effective over decades at curbing the spread of destructive weapons.
It would also be a mistake for either side to reintroduce the banned weapons onto their own territory or elsewhere. "
--"The United States and its allies should make efforts to bring Russia back into compliance with the treaty, and Russia needs to know that defiance will come at a cost. "

CorkerUS-Russia Relationsdocno: 449895News | January 8, 2015Improved Saturn Positions Help Spacecraft Navigation, Planet Studies, Fundamental PhysicsScientists have used the National Science Foundation's Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) radio-telescope system and NASA's Cassini spacecraft to measure the position of Saturn and its family of moons to within about a mile -- at a range of nearly a billion miles.
This feat improves astronomers' knowledge of the dynamics of our Solar System and also benefits interplanetary spacecraft navigation and research on fundamental physics.The researchers, from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), used the continent-wide VLBA to pinpoint the position of Cassini as it orbited Saturn over the past decade by receiving the signal from the spacecraft's radio transmitter.
Combined with information about Cassini's orbit from NASA's Deep Space Network, the VLBA observations allowed the scientists to make the most accurate determinations yet of the position of the center of mass, called the barycenter, of Saturn and its numerous moons.The scientists presented the results of their work at the American Astronomical Society's meeting in Seattle, Washington.The measurement, some 50-100 times more precise than those provided by ground-based optical telescopes, was possible because of the VLBA's great resolving power, or ability to discern fine detail.
With its 10 dish antennas spread from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands, the VLBA operates as a single radio telescope with a virtual size nearly equal to the Earth's diameter.The result is a greatly improved ephemeris -- a table of predicted positions -- for the Saturnian system.
"An accurate ephemeris is one of the basic tools of astronomy, and this work is a great step toward tying together our understanding of the orbits of the outer planets and those of the inner planets," said Dayton Jones, of JPL, in Pasadena, California.
"The orbits of the inner planets are well tied together, but those of the outer planets, including Saturn, have not been tied as well to each other or to those of the inner planets," Jones said.The improved positional information will directly benefit scientists' ability to precisely navigate interplanetary spacecraft.
In addition, it will help refine measurements of the masses of other Solar System objects.
Also, the positional precision will improve predictions of when Saturn or its rings will pass in front of background stars, events that provide a variety of research opportunities.Other benefits will come to studies of several aspects of fundamental physics.
The new positional information will help researchers improve their precision when timing the radio pulses from pulsars -- spinning superdense neutron stars.
Such timing will help answer unsolved questions about particle physics and the exact nature of the highly-compressed material inside a neutron star.
Ongoing projects that time the pulses from multiple pulsars spread across our Milky Way Galaxy in an attempt to detect the effects of passing gravitational waves also will benefit from the improved Saturn ephemeris, which also improves the overall Solar System ephemeris.VLBA measurements of the position of Cassini have even helped scientists who seek to make ever-more-stringent tests of Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity by observing small changes in the apparent positions of strongly-emitting quasars as Saturn passes near them on the sky.The position the scientists determined is that of the barycenter -- the center of mass -- of Saturn and its moons.
When two bodies are in orbit, they both rotate about the barycenter.
For example, the barycenter of the Sun and Jupiter is just outside the surface of the Sun, and the barycenter of the Earth and our Moon is about 1700 kilometers beneath the Earth's surface.
The barycenter of Saturn and its largest moon, Titan, is about 30 kilometers from the center of Saturn.
The barycenter of Saturn and all its moons (some 62 at current count) is what follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun.In other studies, the VLBA has been used to measure the positions of Mars-orbiting satellites, and Voyager 1, the most distant man-made object, now some 12 billion miles (19 billion kilometers) from Earth on a journey that began with its launch in 1977.In 2016, NASA's Juno spacecraft will begin orbiting Jupiter.
"We plan to use similar techniques on this spacecraft, and improve the orbit for Jupiter as well," Jones said.Jones worked with William Folkner, Robert Jacobson, and Christopher Jacobs, all of JPL, and Jon Romney, Vivek Dhawan, and Edward Fomalont, of the NRAO.The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation, operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.

Privacy Statement .docno: 452969 Missile ThreatA Project of the George C. Marshall and Claremont InstitutesHaney: Strategic Deterrence More Than a Nuclear TriadDoD NewsOriginally published athttp://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp story_id=85225Posted on January 16, 2015 by editorWASHINGTON (NNS) - The United States' strategic deterrent includes a triad of nuclear delivery platforms, but other critical elements range from intelligence and missile defense to space and cyber capabilities and a capable workforce, Navy Adm.  Cecil Haney said here today.The commander of U.S. Strategic Command spoke on strategic deterrence in the 21st century during a discussion moderated by Thom Shanker of the New York Times and hosted by the Atlantic Council's Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security.The strategic deterrent includes a robust and agile intelligence apparatus, a synthesis of dedicated space and ground sensors that provide critical early warning for missile launchers and bomber threats, national nuclear command and control and the necessary infrastructure to sustain nuclear weapons without fully testing the warheads, the admiral said.Other parts of the deterrent are a credible missile defense system that defends against limited attacks from rogue nations, cyberspace and space capabilities, trained and ready people, a campaign plan that orients assigned capabilities and activities toward a common purpose, and synchronized treaties, policies and strategies, Haney added.A Whole-of-Government Approach"This is not just capability but a whole-of-government approach that requires our attention and the necessary resources," Haney said, adding that the Nuclear Deterrent Enterprise Review Group recently established by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel provides important support for the nation's deterrent.Even in an era of significant resource constraints the nation must get 21st century deterrence right, Haney said, and must make clear to adversaries or potential adversaries that restraint is always the better course.
"It will require us to work together as a team, as partners - the government, the private sector and academia," he said, "to shape policy that will have a meaningful impact on our national security.
"Haney recalled President Barack Obama's 2009 Prague speech, in which Obama publicly stated his goal for a world free of nuclear weapons, and said the new START treaty between the United States and Russia - formally called Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms - is an effort to work toward that goal.Deterrents Can Fail"The president's 2013 Nuclear Weapons Employment Strategy and strategic documents such as the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review make it clear that as long as nuclear weapons exist," Haney said, "the United States must maintain a strong and credible safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent and   be prepared for the possibility that deterrents can fail.
"Of the multiple states around the globe who have nuclear weapons or aspirations of acquiring them, the admiral mentioned Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.Russia has had more than a decade of investments and modernization across its strategic nuclear forces, he said, adding that the U.S. approach to dealing with Russia in this context today is not about continuing the Cold War.
"This is about emerging capability at a time of significant concerns about Russians' execution of their near and abroad strategy," Haney said, adding that Russia has significant cyber capability.A Time of Significant ConcernsRussia also has significant cyber capability and Russian leaders have publicly stated that they are developing counter-space capabilities and that Russia's armed forces have anti-satellite weapons and conduct anti-satellite research.China also is modernizing its strategic forces, the admiral said, by enhancing silo-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, conducting the first fleet tests of a new mobile missile and making progress on a successor expected to be another road-mobile ICBM capable of carrying multiple warheads.
China is also testing and integrating new ballistic missile submarines, providing that nation with its first sea-based strategic nuclear deterrent, Haney said.
"As I'm sure you're aware," he told the audience, "they're also developing multidimensional space capabilities supporting their access-denial campaign.
But with more than 60 nations operating satellites in space, it's extremely problematic to see China conducting missiles designed to destroy satellites.
"North Korea continues to advance its nuclear ambitions, the admiral added, and Iran has made no secret of its desire to acquire nuclear weapons.21st Century DeterrentsHaney said, "21st century deterrents must be tailored to specific adversaries and threats, and in an integrated manner, so we can predict what deters and what prevents escalation.
"Haney's top priority is to deter strategic attack and provide the nation with a safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent force, but he's also interested in international partnerships and promoting innovation for future capabilities.In the past year he's had meetings with defense ministers of South Korea, France and Australia, a former Japanese defense minister, the United Kingdom's vice defense chief, and five partners involved in space-sharing agreements.In October, he said, "we conducted a command-and-control exercise designed to train our Defense Department forces and access our joint operational readiness across all my mission areas with a specific focus on nuclear readiness.
"Accessing Joint Operational ReadinessStratcom did this in conjunction with U.S. Northern Command, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, and Canadian partners in exercises that included Vigilant Shield, Positive Response and Determined Dragon.Another of Haney's high priorities is bolstering Stratcom's ability to anticipate change and confront uncertainty with agility and innovation.
"Last summer we cut the ribbon at U.S. Strategic Command's War Gaming Center back there at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, to help enable and challenge our thinking with the ability to look at alternative scenarios, some plausible today and some unthinkable tomorrow," the admiral explained.
"We need to grow innovative leaders, identify new operational concepts and continue to develop cutting-edge technology so we can continue to evolve our ideas on how to deter our adversaries and potential adversaries and, of course, assure our allies.
"Finding Problems, Plucking Them OutBut Haney said the nation would not have a credible strategic deterrent today if it were not for the men and women, military and civilian, "who conduct and contribute to our strategic deterrent mission day in and day out, across all areas.
From under the sea to geosynchronous orbit, they are making concrete contributions to our security 24/7, 365 days a year.
"About the much-publicized problems over the past year with some members of the nuclear force, Haney said that when such problems are found, no matter where they are, "we pluck [them] out of our system   and get through some root-cause analysis to figure out what we should be doing associated with that particular problem.
"He added, "When you look at 90 percent of our team, [they] come to work every day to do the right thing, passionate over the mission.
"In any organization, the admiral said, "You have to continue to work on that other percentage of folks   and in this case I'm very happy that we found the problem, eradicated the problem from our system and went to work with this Nuclear Enterprise Review business to work on those problems.
"Charged About the MissionHaney said he spent 2014 traveling and meeting with all of those involved in the strategic deterrent mission.
"I can say unequivocally that those folks are fired up and charged about the mission," he said.
"I think the rest of us need to support them in how we talk about it and associate it with the plans we have now.
"The admiral added, "I am proud of working with those great Americans.

Senate Appropriators Recommend $604.5B for PentagonJul.
31, 2012 - 01:57PM   |By KATE BRANNEN   |Filed UnderWorld NewsAmericasTo meet the Budget Control Act's caps for defense spending, the U.S. Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee transferred $5 billion out of the Pentagon's base budget into a separate spending bill for operations in Afghanistan.The subcommittee recommends $511 billion for DoD's base budget and $93 billion for overseas contingency operations (OCO), for a total of $604.5 billion.
The Pentagon requested $88 billion in OCO funding.When asked where the extra OCO money came from, an aide to Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the money had been transferred from one bill to the other to keep the base budget within the budget law's new spending caps.
The Pentagon's contingency funds are exempt from the federal discretionary spending caps.The panel looked to transfer anything it considered to be war-related, she said.This is the first of the 2013 defense bills that stays within the Budget Control Act's spending caps, including the president's request.Funding for the Pentagon this year is nearly $29 billion less than was appropriated in 2012, primarily due to the drawdown of forces in Afghanistan, Inouye said.The $511 billion does not include military construction or nuclear weapons programs managed by the Department of Energy, both of which are included in separate appropriations bills.Within the top line, the Senate panel made several adjustments to the Pentagon's spending request, including 475 reductions to programs requested in the budget.For example, the subcommittee cut $3.8 billion in "prior year funds that are excess to defense needs due to program terminations, schedule delays or contract savings," a subcommittee statement said.The subcommittee endorsed a plan from the Senate Armed Services Committee to pause all force structure changes proposed by the Air Force until an independent national commission can weigh in.
"The bill directs the use of existing funds for procurements of the C-27 Spartan [aircraft] and the RQ-4 Global Hawk Block 30," the subcommittee statement reads.
The Air Force had proposed canceling both programs in its 2013 budget request.The bill would also add $800 million to sustain current Air Force structure.After making its reductions, the subcommittee redirected that money to where it saw shortfalls.For example, the subcommittee recommends adding advance procurement dollars for an additional Virginia-class submarine and an amphibious ship.
It also reverses the Navy's proposal to "prematurely retire" seven cruisers and two amphibious ships by providing $2.4 billion to keep them operating through 2014.The bill adds $1 billion to the National Guard and Reserve equipment account.According to a subcommittee statement, funds were added for Army helicopters, including Sikorsky's UH-60 Black Hawk and Boeing's CH-47 Chinook and AH-64 Apache.The bill also increases funds to complete development of the Army's Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance Surveillance System and adds $142 million for high-definition video sensors requested by U.S. Special Operations Command.The subcommittee also recommends adding $194 million for additional Patriot PAC-3 missiles.
It would increase funds to continue Abrams tank production, which the Army has said it would like to temporarily stop so that it can fund higher priority items.The bill would fully fund the requested number of Lockheed Martin-built F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, the Pentagon's biggest and most expensive weapon program.The subcommittee recommends adding $500 million to the Missile Defense Agency, including $211 billion for Iron Dome, a rocket-defense system being developed jointly for Israel.For Afghanistan, the bill would provide $5 billion for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, $200 million for the Commander's Emergency Response Program and $350 million for the Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund.The full Senate Appropriations Committee plans to mark up the bill Aug. 2, when several lawmakers will offer their own amendments.While the four key committees have now spoken, final decisions have not been made.
The House of Representatives has passed its version of the defense authorization and appropriations bills but the Senate has not, with no plans to take up these measures until after the August congressional recess and the Democratic and Republican national conventions.docno: 454513Pratt & Whitney Statement on DOT&E Report(Source: Pratt & Whitney; issued Jan 20, 2015)Similar to previous reports, the latest DOT&E F-35 report points to the tremendous amount of positive progress made by the F-35 program last year.
The F135 engine specifically has averaged 98 percent mission availability, achieved more than 26,000 ground test hours, more than 21,500 flight hours, and powered more than 750 vertical landings.The F135 proved its durability through very rigorous live fire testing, and the engine also performed exceptionally well during carrier trials from the USS Nimitz in November, powering the F-35C without a single instance of unscheduled engine maintenance.To date, we have delivered 183 production engines to our customers.This DOT&E report lists propulsion issues that are well known to the F-35 Joint Program Office and the Services.
These issues have been well documented and we are aligned with our customers on solutions.We have validated and approved an upgrade to the fleet to address the Eglin event, eliminated the flight restrictions on the SDD fleet, and begun implementing changes for the remainder of the fleet.The F-35 program is 60 percent through flight test development.
We expect to learn things in development testing, and we will apply lessons learned to field the most technologically advanced and reliable engine for the warfighter.
2014 was a year of great momentum for the F-35 program on all fronts.We remain extremely confident we'll be able to support our customers' future major program milestones, including U.S. Marine Corps Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in 2015 and U.S. Air Force IOC in 2016.
( EDITOR'S NOTE: Contrasting with Pratt's highly (excessively ) optimistic statement above, here is what the latest (FY2014) OT&E report actually says about the F135 engine (emphasis in bold typeface is ours):-- Nowhere does the report state that "The F135 engine specifically has averaged 98 percent mission availability," as claimed above by Pratt, nor does it mention "750 vertical landings. "
-- What the report actually says is that " Aircraft availability was flat over most of the past year, maintaining an average for the fleet of 37 percent for the 12-month rolling period. "
This is exactly the same as reported a year ago, in the 2013 report.
In other words, there is no improvement whatsoever in availability .-- "Inspections of the engines on all variants led to discoveries on nine production and test aircraft requiring engine replacement. "
(page 45) In other words, one in ten F135 engines has the same defect, and must be replaced.-- "Availability of the operational test aircraft will continue to be [adversely] affected in CY15 and CY16 by the depot time required for [engine] modifications. "
(Page 40)"It is [still] not clear what occurred differently than expected in the air vehicle and/or engine that caused the excessive rubbing" which led to the June 23 catastrophic failure.
(page 45)-- "Additional details and analyses of the uncontained F135 fan blade release and subsequent fuel fire in an F-35A at Eglin AFB in June are needed to support and update the existing engine vulnerability assessment. "
(page 42)-- "The uncontained F135 fan blade release and subsequent fuel fire in an F-35A at Eglin AFB in June provides an additional data point that needs to be reviewed and analyzed to support the F-35 vulnerability assessment. "
(page 57)-- Operating restrictions stemming from the engine failure remain in force, and "must be relieved for the test aircraft such that all blocked test points are made available. "

AM General, Lockheed Martin, and Oshkosh (pictured) are competing.
Source: IHS/Daniel WasserblyKey PointsThe size and deployability of JLTVs is questioned by the Pentagon's director of operational test and evaluationTesters found that USMC amphibious assaults would suffer from the added time needed to deploy JLTVsPentagon testers have found that Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) prototypes are slow to deploy from ship to shore and, therefore, leaves US Marine Corps (USMC) units "vulnerable to threats".The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation annual report on the previous year's testing, released on 20 January, found that during developmental test/operational test (DT/OT) events, USMC units with JLTVs were able to execute amphibious assault missions, but were hampered by the new trucks' lack of deployability.
"The JLTVs have large visual signature and their slow manoeuvre time from ship to shore prevents a Marine Expeditionary Unit from executing assault missions with tactical surprise, increases the time to close combat power ashore, and renders the unit vulnerable to threats," the report said.
"Testing showed that JLTVs are slower to load, prepare for fording, and transition to manoeuvre ashore than HMMWV [Humvees]" that they are meant to replace, the document said.
Testers explained that the issues were caused by the JLTV's overall larger size (vehicle suspensions are dropped so they can better fit in amphibious ships) and "delays that occur while awaiting suspension mode, and other vehicle adjustments" such as adjusting tyre pressure.A spokesman for the Army Program Executive Office for Combat Support & Combat Service Support declined to comment on whether the office has developed a plan to address deficiencies outlined in the report.The DT/OT events occurred in April 2014, with US Army and USMC units using CH-47F Chinook and CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters for an air assault mission, and a USMC unit using Landing Craft Utility vessels for amphibious assault missions.Testers found that units with JLTVs - and organic armour assets - can execute air assault missions.However, "the three JLTV contractor vehicles were more difficult to rig, de-rig, and load weapons due to vehicle height and lack of vehicle handholds and footholds than HMMWV," the report said.
"They had limited space to carry crew, mission essential equipment, weapons, and their sustainment load because of the small interior compartment.
"The DT/OT revealed that JLTVs have better manoeuvrability in soft soil and better fording capability than legacy Humvees, but crew visibility is lower "because of smaller windows, placement of mission equipment, and positioning of window panels".ANALYSISIt is no surprise that JLTVs have a larger 'visual signature' than the smaller Humvee; they are indeed bigger vehicles and ride higher from the ground to protect against underbelly mine blasts.However, it is notable that this larger size affects the speed at which marines can prepare the vehicles for battle (due to time spent raising the suspension, inflating tyres, and climbing to load equipment).The USMC has at times appeared a reluctant customer for the JLTV as the corps is trying to get lighter and more mobile after years spent fighting land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with heavier platforms.
Marine planners had accepted the size and weight trade-off to gain more protection, but it will be interesting to see if the deployability issue can be resolved or be justified.Either way, the question must be answered soon because the USMC's planned 5,500 JLTVs are to be bought early in the production run and an initial operating capability is scheduled for fiscal year 2018.Related article: AUSA Winter 2014: Army to seek new medium truck family in mid-2020s(585 words)Related IHS ProductsIHS Jane's Defence: PlatformsIHS Jane's Defence: Air & SpaceIHS Jane's Defence: LandIHS Jane's Defence: SeaIHS Jane's Defence: Land PlatformsIHS Jane's Land Warfare Platforms: Armoured Fighting VehiclesIHS Jane's Land Warfare Platforms: Artillery & Air DefenceIHS Jane's Land Warfare Platforms: Logistics, Support & UnmannedIHS Jane's Land Warfare Platforms: System UpgradesIHS Jane's Defence WeeklyBy posting a comment you confirm that you have read and accept our Posting Rules and our Terms of Use of this site.
