docno: 1111Transition services now mandatory for soldiersBy Jim Tice - Staff writerPosted : Tuesday Apr 3, 2012 16:44:56 EDTFORT KNOX, Ky. - Soldiers now must participate in <PROG>transition services</PROG> before they leave active duty.An execution order requiring them to make use of the services is in force throughout the Army.The order applies to all soldiers who are leaving active duty, whether they are <P3>Regular Army members</P3> who are separating or retiring or reservists demobilizing after six months or more on active duty.The order, which implements a directive issued last year by <P1>Army Secretary John McHugh</P1>, further requires that transition processing begin at least 12 months before a soldier leaves active duty and that the soldier's commander oversee the process.The new procedures will be bolstered later this year when the <DOC>Veterans Opportunity to Work Act</DOC> is implemented Nov. 20 for all the military services."From the Army standpoint, we are planning for that mandate, and getting additional resources to support implementation across the active and reserve components," said <P1>Walter M. Herd</P1>, <REL>director</REL> of the Army Career and Alumni Program.This will result in about a 300 percent increase in the number of soldiers participating in <PROG>transition services</PROG>, Herd said.<PROG>ACAP</PROG>, a <PROG>longtime Army program</PROG>, <REL>assists</REL> <P3>departing soldiers</P3>, family members and <P3>Army career civilians</P3> in preparing for civilian life through myriad counseling, education, job-preparation and job-search services at 54 centers in the U.S. and overseas.The centers are staffed by counselors who <REL>have</REL> graduate degrees in counseling and who can <REL>link up</REL> <P3>departing soldiers</P3> with <REL>training and services offered by</REL> the Army and other government agencies, such as the Labor and <ORG>Veterans Affairs</ORG> departments.<PROG>ACAP</PROG> also <REL>operates a new</REL> <ORG>24-hour, seven-day-a-week call center</ORG> here, and an <ORG>interactive website</ORG> for the virtual delivery of information and services, to include <P3>counseling.Regular Army soldiers</P3> leaving active duty should begin their transition 24 months in advance of retirement and 18 to 12 months in advance of separation, Herd said."Ideally, the soldier should go to an <PROG>ACAP</PROG> center, <REL>receive</REL> a pre-separation briefing and <REL>begin to map out</REL> his or her <DOC>transition plan</DOC>," he said.  "This will be an individual plan to lay out how the person will transition from being a soldier to being a civilian. "The plan will include what classes the soldier will attend, and specifically what preparations should be made, whether he is leaving service for college or to enter the civilian work force.<PROG>ACAP</PROG> <REL>works closely with</REL> the Army Continuing Education System and <REL>can coordinate services for</REL> <P3>departing soldiers</P3> who plan to attend college or who require professional accreditation.For example, if a soldier wants to become a plumber after leaving the Army, <PROG>ACAP</PROG> and ACES counselors can assist the soldier in becoming professionally accredited.Herd said reservists normally are mobilized for a year, so they need to begin their transition processing immediately upon coming on active duty."For most of the <P3>Reserve soldiers</P3> who are going back to the same job they left, the transition will be simpler than for those who don't have an existing job," Herd said.Commanders' roleA second major goal of the execution order requires commanders to be responsible for ensuring that their soldiers are successfully transitioned."This is really a big change, as in the past, transition processing really was a staff issue, rather than a commander responsibility," Herd said.The new system is designed so that commanders will be notified when their soldiers begin transitioning processing."The commander can delegate the monitoring of a soldier's transition to subordinate officers and [noncommissioned officers], but he is responsible for making sure that the soldiers start the process at least 12 months out," Herd said.Officials expect that first sergeants and squad leaders will be major players in this process.The commander will then get periodic reports showing how many transitioning soldiers in the company, battalion or brigade <REL>have completed</REL> pre-separation counseling, prepared a résumé, attended briefings and other <PROG>ACAP</PROG> activities."The long-term plan is to <REL>monitor a soldier's transition processing through</REL> Army <PROG>Career Tracker</PROG>, <REL>a system for</REL> enlisted soldiers, officers and Army civilians to plot their career milestones."We aren't quite there yet, but we will get plugged into <PROG>Career Tracker</PROG>" Herd said.Herd, a <P2>retired colonel</P2> and <P2>former brigade commander</P2>, acknowledged that with the ongoing <PROG>force alignment and drawdown programs</PROG>, such as the <PROG>Qualitative Service Program</PROG> boards, some soldiers will be required to leave active duty early, and will not have a full year for transitioning processing."Under those conditions, we will start a soldier's transitioning processing as soon as possible," he said.docno: 111982 <PROG>Missile ThreatA Project</PROG> of the George C. Marshall and Claremont InstitutesSequestration, Obama Budget Cuts Threaten <TECH>Much-Needed Missile DefenseRandy</TECH> DuncanPosted on December 31, 2012 by editorDec. 30, 2012 - <P1>British military historian John Keegan</P1> once said, "It's a necessary quality of a diplomat or a politician that he will compromise.  Uncompromising politicians or diplomats get you into the most terrible trouble. "That may never have been truer than it is today, as <ORG>Congress</ORG> struggles to come up with a deal to avoid sending our country over the fiscal cliff at year's end.It would be nice if <ORG>Congress</ORG> and the president would be inspired to take defense of the homeland more seriously.Perhaps most concerning are the draconian defense "sequestration" cuts that are set to take effect January 2, 2013. The $500 billion reduction in military spending triggered by 2011's <DOC>Budget Control Act</DOC> would be added to the $487 billion the <ORG>Obama administration</ORG> already eliminated in this year's budget request.For months, lawmakers have been warned of the potential economic impact of these indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts.  A joint study between <P1>Dr. Stephen S. Fuller of George Mason University</P1> and <ORG>Chmura Economics and Analytics</ORG> showed that America could lose an estimated 2.14 million jobs if <ORG>Congress</ORG> does nothing to prevent the automatic sequestration cuts.But the effects of sequestration - on top of already reduced military spending on the president's watch - extend well-beyond our fragile economy.  Military brass and defense experts agree that such haphazard cuts would gut critical defense programs that protect this nation and our troops from <P1>harm.Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta</P1> has said that "if additional efforts are made to go after the defense budget, I think it could have a serious impact in terms of our ability to implement" the Pentagon's stated defense strategy.  This is especially true in light of significant cuts already imposed.  As these cuts are beyond flesh and into the bone.  Further cuts now are threatening to become reckless endangerment of the American people.One urgent area of concern is missile defense, <REL>particularly in light of</REL> North Korea's successful <PROG>long-range rocket test</PROG> earlier this month.  While the <ORG>White House</ORG> deemed the launch a "highly provocative act," it was a stark reminder of the importance of investing in defensive systems that can both deter attacks and protect us increasing threats from rogue nations.Time and again our "Cold War" focused defense, diplomatic and intelligence apparatus and intelligentsia have been "surprised" by global events empowered by new social media.  Witness Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Syria, Libya and tumult in Mali.  One of the U.S. top defense and intelligence priorities is to prevent strategic surprise.  And yet the collective political group think is to apparently allow these multiple layered cuts to happen.  It is unconscionable.An immediate problem is that our <DOC>current missile defense budget</DOC> is woefully inadequate.  In total, the president lopped $3.6 billion off the projected budget for the <ORG>Missile Defense Agency</ORG> (<ORG>MDA</ORG>) over the next 4 years.  This is in addition to the $1.4 billion reduction for <ORG>MDA</ORG> from 2009 to 2013."I'm disappointed, very much, in the reductions to the missile defense budget over the last four years, much of which has come at the expense of our homeland defense as well as the development of <WEA>next-generation missile defense systems</WEA>," <P1>retiring Sen. Jon Kyl</P1>, a noted defense hawk, <REL>told a recent forum sponsored by</REL> the <ORG>American Foreign Policy Council.For</ORG> example, the president's 2013 budget slashed the number of <WEA>Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs)</WEA> - <REL>our first line of defense against</REL> a <WEA>long-range missile</WEA> attack from North Korea - from 44 interceptors to 30. A third GBI site along the East Coast <REL>continues to be a hot topic on</REL> <ORG>Capitol Hill</ORG>, but the potential for funding such a program appears dim considering we aren't properly supporting the sites we already have in Alaska and California.  As <P1>Sen. Kyl</P1> aptly noted in his comments to <ORG>AFP</ORG>C , funding for GBIs has decreased from $2.5 billion annually under <P1>President Bush</P1> to only $1 billion under the <ORG>Obama administration</ORG>.The <WEA>next-generation Standard Missile-3 (SM-3)</WEA> has also been a target of significant cuts, this despite two high-profile, successful tests of the interceptor this spring and summer.Currently, the U.S. and Japanese navies are employing more than 130 <WEA>first-generation SM-3s</WEA>, but the <WEA>upgraded missile</WEA>, which is set to roll off production lines in 2015, offers enhanced capabilities to protect America and its allies.<ORG>MDA</ORG>'s original plan was to buy 62 SM-3 "I-Bs" but in his 2013 budget <P1>President Obama</P1> cut that number to a meager 29 and sliced the <DOC>I-B budget</DOC> in half.  The timing could not be worse considering that commanders in the field are saying that our current inventories of <WEA>SM-3s aboard Aegis ships</WEA> are already insufficient.  A recent classified STRATCOM exercise, reported by InsideDefense.com, <REL>confirmed the assertion of</REL> a <WEA>ballistic missile</WEA> shortfall.Most significantly, these cuts to GBIs and SM-3s do not take into account the prospect of sequestration.  In a letter to <ORG>Congress</ORG> last month, Panetta warned that sequestration would result in an additional "23 percent cut in <PROG>weapons program</PROG> would drive up unit costs and lead to reductions in quantity of one third or more. "While both Democrats and Republicans can agree that current budget deficits are unsustainable, shrinking the <DOC>U.S. missile defense budget</DOC> at a time when threats are exponentially increasing could prove pennywise but pound foolish.  After all, North Korea is far from the only hostile nation on our radar.  Iran and Syria remain aggressive, and the threat of Syria's weapons falling into the hands of <ORG>jihadi-minded militias</ORG> poses a very real threat to global security.Avoiding such a fate will take real compromise from <ORG>Congress</ORG> and the president over the next few days.  Without a deal to avoid even more severe cuts to defense, the American people may well be in "the most terrible trouble. "One thing that should be clear to the collective intelligentsia and politicians, strategic surprise will happen.  The American people and our allies just don't deserve to have a North Korean or Iranian missile land on our heads because we failed to properly fund missile defense.Randy Duncan is a retired <ORG>Navy</ORG> captain who <REL>served at</REL> the <ORG>Defense Missile and Space Intelligence Center</ORG> and the Defense Intelligence Agency.This entry was posted in Publications and tagged <WEA>Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI)</WEA> , Iran , Jon Kyl , Leon Panetta , North Korea , Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) , Syria , Budget , <ORG>Missile Defense Agency</ORG> by editor .

Rumours circulating for the past few months suggest that some within the <ORG>US defence and intelligence community</ORG> believe China is preparing to conduct another <PROG>ASAT test</PROG>," <ORG>Union of Concerned Scientists</ORG>, a Cambridge-based body of scientists reported.China's previous tests caused concern in India too with assertions by the Indian defence officials that New Delhi also should acquire such a capability."Just before Christmas, a high-ranking US defence official told us that the <ORG>Obama administration</ORG> <REL>was very concerned about</REL> an imminent Chinese <PROG>ASAT test</PROG>," <P1>Gregory Kulacki</P1>, <P2>China project manager</P2> of the group and <P2>senior analyst</P2> reported two days ago."Given these high-level administration concerns, and past Chinese practice, there seems to be a strong possibility China will conduct an <PROG>ASAT test</PROG> within the next few weeks.  What kind of test and what the target might be is unclear," Kulacki wrote in his report.Reacting to the report, an editorial in <ORG>China's state-run Global Times</ORG> said today that concerns that the test will put the <WEA>US strategic satellites</WEA> at risk is "over blown"."China reportedly conducted an <PROG>anti-satellite test</PROG> in early 2007, which caused a great uproar.  Some analysts said that even if China really once again launches a test, it will not strike down satellites, but invalidate them," it said without stating whether the test would be conducted."Whether China will launch new <PROG>anti-satellite test</PROG> is still unknown.  However China should continue substantive research on striking satellites.  In the foreseeable future, gap between China and the US cannot be eliminated by China's development of <WEA>space weapons</WEA>," the editorial said."The US advantage is overwhelming.  Before strategic uncertainties between China and the US can disappear, China urgently needs to have an outer space trump card", it said.<DOC>"China's public policy</DOC> is peaceful use of space, which is also China's real desire.  China has no interest in launching a <PROG>large-scale space race</PROG> with the US.  China and Russia jointly initiated a programme to avoid an arms race <REL>in</REL> outer space in 2008, but this proposal was refused by the US", it said."Against this background, it is necessary for China to have the ability to strike US satellites.  This deterrent can provide strategic protection to Chinese satellites and the whole country's national security", it said."The US will continue to harass and even obstruct China's developing of its space capabilities.  China should make tactical adjustments to reduce trouble.  It is key for China to have the ability of strategic retaliation.  It is a safeguard for China to deter the US from taking risky action against China in this period of great transition," it said.The planned test by China comes in the backdrop of the launch of China's own GPS <REL>called</REL> <WEA>BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS)</WEA> <REL>currently being used by</REL> <ORG>Chinese military</ORG> and a number of official bodies.China plans to launch 20 more satellites to improve its functioning.Some US officials suspect China may want to go higher than it did in either 2007 or 2010, targeting an object 12,000 miles or so above Earth's surface.This ability to reach <TECH>Medium-Earth Orbit (MEO)</TECH> <REL>could theoretically put the constellation of</REL> <WEA>US Global Positioning System navigational satellites</WEA> at risk, a report in Space.Com said."But there are good reasons for China not to destroy a satellite at this orbit, including that China plans to use this part of space," Kulacki wrote."Creating debris, as it now understands, would threaten its own satellites.  Over the next several years, China plans to place more than 20 new navigational satellites <REL>in</REL> MEO," he wrote.Kulacki <REL>urged</REL> the <ORG>Obama Administration</ORG> to <REL>attempt to dissuade China from conducting</REL> any more destructive <PROG>ASAT test</PROG>s.Both the United States and the Soviet Union abandoned such tests as their <PROG>space programmes</PROG> matured, he notes."Hopefully, China will eventually come to a similar conclusion," Kulacki wrote adding that "beginning a meaningful bilateral dialogue on space security between the United States and China could hasten the day.

Frank Wolf (R-Va. ), <REL>chairman</REL> of the House appropriations subcommittee that <REL>funds</REL> the <ORG>U.S. space agency</ORG>, that they support his panel's approach to<WEA> commercial crew vehicle</WEA> development."It seems unlikely that <ORG>NASA</ORG> will receive significant budgetary relief in the foreseeable future," the three retired astronauts wrote in a May 4 letter to Wolf.  "Consequently, it is mandatory to maximize return on the limited funds available to access low Earth orbit.  An early downselect would seem to be prudent in order to maximize the possibility of developing a <WEA>crew-carrying spacecraft</WEA> in time to be operationally useful. "House members are scheduled to debate the <ORG>Wolf panel</ORG>'s response to <ORG>NASA</ORG>'s fiscal 2013 budget request on Tuesday.  Report language accompanying the Wolf bill, which was approved by the <ORG>full House Appropriations Committee</ORG>, calls for "an immediate downselect to a single competitor or, at most, the execution of a <DOC>leader-follower paradigm</DOC> in which <ORG>NASA</ORG> makes one large award to a main commercial partner and a second small award to a backup partner. "<ORG>NASA</ORG> prefers to maintain competition among companies vying for funds under its commercial crew development (CCDev) seed-money effort as long as possible, in the belief that it will ultimately cost less to develop a vehicle that way.  Under pressure from some of the CCDev competitors, the agency also opted to continue the program under <DOC>Space Act Agreements</DOC>, rather than using the more restrictive <DOC>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)</DOC> approach.Wolf's panel argued that a quick downselect would allow <ORG>NASA</ORG> to <REL>move back to</REL> the FAR procurement approach and avoid a complicated transition from funding more than one company under the Space Act to a FAR procurement.  The three Apollo commanders, who <REL>earlier urged <ORG>Congress</ORG> to resist</REL> <ORG>White House</ORG> plans to hand off human access to the private sector, agreed that a Space Act procurement "would be unlikely to provide the documentation that we normally depend upon to provide high confidence in reaching our technical goals. ""We all agree that our country has painted itself into a corner and does not now, nor will for many years, have a U.S. government craft suitable for carrying cargo or crew to the <ORG>International Space Station</ORG>," the astronauts wrote.  "The reputation of our country and the potential liability associated with carrying United States and international crews to and from the ISS dictates that we do everything possible to ensure that any commercial crew service meets standards equal to those that we would enforce would the craft be government owned and operated.

Work is underway simultaneously on two <WEA>strategic missiles</WEA> of different classes.According to <P1>Sergei Karakaev</P1>, the <REL>commander</REL> of Russiaa  s Strategic Missile Forces, these is a heavy, 100-ton, liquid-propellant intercontinental <WEA>ballistic missile</WEA> (ICBM) that <REL>should outperform</REL> the world's most powerful <WEA>R-36M</WEA>2 Voevoda (<ORG>NATO</ORG> reporting name: SS-18 Satan), and a solid-fuel ICBM <REL>scheduled to replace</REL> the fifth-generation Yars systems (the RS-24 and the Topol-M).'Since the potential of <WEA>solid-fuel ICBMs</WEA> <REL>could become insufficient for</REL> overcoming the <WEA>American missile defense system</WEA> going forward, a <WEA>heavy liquid-propellant ICBM</WEA> is needed to perform this task.  Such an ICBM <REL>will allow the creation of</REL> a <WEA>non-nuclear, high-precision, strategic weapon</WEA> with a practically global range, unless the United States abandons its program,' Karakaev said.This is the first time Russia has spoken about creating a new <WEA>solid-fuel missile</WEA>.  According to <P1>Gen. Karakaev</P1>, several launches of a prototype of this missile took place in 2012' most recently on Oct. 24.This puts an end to the debate on whether <ORG>Russia's Strategic Missile Forces</ORG> need a heavyweight liquid-propellant missile.Russia undertook a large-scale modernization of the <WEA>Topol family</WEA> in the 1990s and adopted the <WEA>Topol-M silos</WEA> (<ORG>NATO</ORG> <REL>reporting name</REL>: <WEA>SS-27</WEA>) in 2000, <REL>followed by</REL> the <WEA>mobile Topol-M2</WEA> several years ago.  It is the <WEA>new Topol</WEA> and the newly adopted <WEA>RS-24 Yars</WEA> that <REL>will be gradually replacing</REL> the decommissioned, first-generation, <WEA>solid-fuel missile</WEA>s.But liquid-propellant missiles <REL>still form the backbone of</REL> the <ORG>strategic deterrence forces</ORG>: the <WEA>UR-100N</WEA> (<ORG>NATO</ORG> <REL>reporting name</REL>: <WEA>SS-19 Stiletto</WEA>) and the <WEA>D -36M</WEA> (<ORG>U.S. Department of Defense</ORG> and <ORG>NATO</ORG> <REL>reporting name</REL>: SS-18 Satan). These, however, are obsolete and will have to be retired over the next few years.New missiles have been slow in arriving to the <ORG>Russia's armed forces</ORG>.  According to an estimate by <P1>Leonid Kalashnikov</P1>, <REL>deputy chairman</REL> of the <ORG>State Duma Defense Committee</ORG>, Russia could receive 100-105 new ICBMs by 2015. If the bet remains on, the <WEA>single-warhead Topol-M</WEA> and the <WEA>three-warhead Yars-24</WEA> <REL>would be able to carry</REL> a total of 110-115 <WEA>warheads</WEA>.  At the same time, the United States is planning to deploy 900 <WEA>ballistic missile</WEA> interceptors worldwide by 2015.The United States withdrew from the <DOC>1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty</DOC> in 2001 and is no longer limited by any restrictions on building up the quantity and quality of such means.  According to Karakaev, it is possible that America could deploy <TECH>anti-missile defenses</TECH> in space.Russia's military and political leadership was counting on successful negotiations with the United States on missile defense.  However, the negotiations have ended in a deadlock; Washington's persistent deployment of surface- and sea-based <TECH>anti-missile defenses</TECH>, coupled with a general deterioration of bilateral relations, have forced the Russian leadership to consider more decisive actions.This is where the idea of a missile capable of carrying a dividing warhead with a large number of individually targeted blocks (which would also have a long range) originated.  Russia already has such missiles' the above-mentioned liquid-propellant <WEA>UR-100N</WEA> and <WEA>R-36M</WEA>. However, these missiles have been on combat duty since the late 1980s, and their service life is nearing an end.Development of new missiles was suspended in the 1990s, when the Strategic Missile Forces were expected to be fully converted to lightweight, <WEA>solid-fuel missile</WEA> complexes.  However, <WEA>lightweight missiles</WEA> <REL>have not been able to become a full-fledged replacement for</REL> liquid-propellant giants.According to <P1>Yuri Zaitsev</P1>, an <P2>expert at the Academy of Engineering Sciences</P2>, 'It's unlikely that the <WEA>lightweight Topol-M</WEA> and the <WEA>Bulava</WEA> [ a new <WEA>sea-based solid-fuel Topol-M based missile</WEA> ] could serve as a worthy substitute for the <WEA>decommissioned missiles</WEA>.'Nonetheless, Russia is not planning to abandon its <WEA>solid-fuel missile</WEA>s either.  <WEA>Solid-fuel missiles</WEA> <REL>are the best match for</REL> <WEA>mobile complexes</WEA>.  This means that Russia will continue developing a replacement for both types of its active-duty missiles.This entry was posted in News and tagged ICBM , <WEA>R-36M</WEA>2 Voevoda , Russia , SS-18 Satan , Topol , by editor .

These include providing flexible mobile accessibility across a growing number of devices; compensating for users' lack of data literacy; achieving the required speed of <TECH>information delivery</TECH>; and ensuring the quality and integrity of source data, Pringle said.As they seek to satisfy growing demand for timely and specific business insight, CIOs must draw on a range of services.  These range from assessing and improving the quality of target data sources and making resulting analyses comprehensible to users, to determining the exact needs of users and ensuring that the particular information they require can be delivered to them at the point of need.The <DOC>Pringle report</DOC> highlights the indispensable role of external services right across the board -- from management consultancies to technical, deployment and maintenance providers -- in developing an organization's capability to harness the value of data.  Its conclusions support the general rule that for every dollar spent on software for <TECH>business intelligence</TECH>, more than two are spent on external service providers, as companies seek to plug gaps in their internal <TECH>data analysis</TECH> capabilities and associated IT skills.The telecommunications and financial services sectors have long exhibited strong demand for external services, but interest is now growing across a number of other sectors, including healthcare , as providers seek to improve patient care by establishing a more holistic view of patients, and travel , as airlines, for example, try to sustain the customer experience yet counteract rising costs.Recognizing the opportunity, outsourced service providers are now ramping up their services and new players are entering the market, Pringle said.  "<TECH>Business intelligence</TECH>, and specifically <TECH>data analytics</TECH>, is one of the highest growth areas in IT generally.  What's particularly interesting as service providers tap into this opportunity is the entry of non-traditional players.  Among them are industry professionals with a lot of operational experience.  They are able to complement data and technology experience with a deep knowledge of how particular organizations need to use data for strategic and competitive advantage.  Their involvement, alongside data experts, helps deliver the speed of results that is so critical now.  Even very large firms don't have all of the skills they need in house, so it makes sense to partner with relevant experts. "Companies shouldn't underestimate the groundwork needed to enable more dynamic, business-driven <TECH>data analytics</TECH>, Pringle added.  "The 'bigger' and more strategic data becomes, the more important it is that the quality is good," he noted.  "Presentation is important too, as most users won't be data experts. " To this end, technology providers need to work harder to hide the complexity of the data, he said, so that only unambiguous and relevant content is served up to users -- aiding their efficiency, rather than distracting them further.Pointing to CIOs' priorities over the year ahead, Pringle concluded, "To avoid projects that spiral out of control, organizations should start small, focusing on where the demand is coming from in the business: is it to understand sales performance in more detail, for example, or to analyze costs in the supply chain  The sensible advice is probably to look at specific issues rather than take a big-bang approach -- then, if data quality turns out to be an issue, you might be able to get away with a fairly packaged service from an IT provider.

Martins</P1> and <P1>Senator Dean Skelos</P1> during their <REL>visit to</REL> WATT in 2011.Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (<TECH>SOFC</TECH>) <REL>are positioned to provide an economical and viable alternative to</REL> small electrical generators in the near future, according to <ORG>WATT Fuel Cell company</ORG> that prepared for initial product rollouts of its products in 2013. The company has recently concluded testing on a 500-watt <WEA>propane-powered unit</WEA> and is planning to demonstrate a 1-kilowatt systems by the end of this year.  "Being able to use accessible fuel is key to the success of the <ORG>fuel cell industry</ORG>, and we've focused on our technology's ability to use readily available gaseous and liquid fuels for commercial and military applications," <P1>Dr. Caine Finnerty</P1>, <REL>president</REL> of WATT Fuel Cell said.  Propane and natural gas will be used commercially, while liquid fuels <REL>such as</REL> Diesel (D2) and JP-8 will be suitable for the military.As part of the system's commercialization WATT has recently refined its patented cell manufacturing process, substantially reducing production times while increasing part quality, performance and yield.  "Our process not only makes cost-effective stack manufacturing a reality, but also permits manufacturing scalability to quickly flex, matching market demand," said <P1>Benjamin Emley</P1>, <P2>technology director</P2> at the company.  According to Emley, the company is presently scaling into full-rate production at its manufacturing facility on Long Island.The <TECH>SOFC</TECH> working principleThe <TECH>SOFC</TECH> working principleEarlier this week <ORG>Parker Hannifin</ORG> and WATT Fuel Cell Corp. <REL>embarked on</REL> a strategic licensing and supply agreement to bring WATT's propane-driven based products to commercial markets. The agreement will provide Parker's an exclusive license of WATT Fuel Cell<REL>'s</REL> low-cost balance-of-plant (BoP) technology and exclusive stack supply for use in 500 to 3000 watt RV, marine and over-the-road trucking markets.  Parker <REL>will manufacture</REL> the BoP and controls and also integrate the fuel cell stacks into complete, packaged <TECH>SOFC</TECH> products.While the agreement with Parker aims at the commercial sector, the <TECH>SOFC</TECH> fuel-cell has many military applications as well, particularly with systems operating on <WEA>JP-8 fuel</WEA>.  With such capability the fuel cell provides a powerful, quiet and logistically efficient energy source for various users, including robotics or unattended communications devices.  WATT Fuel Cell has already integrated systems operating on both gaseous and liquid fuel.  The fuel cell system replaces batteries offering six times the capacity for a given net weight (the weight of batteries providing less than 200 Wh/kg can be replaced by <WEA>JP-8 fuel</WEA> cell driving more than 12,000 Wh/kg). Key for performance improvement is the reduction in the size of the fuel cell and its electronic control circuits.Typical applications of <TECH>SOFC</TECH> employ cylindrical ducts flowing the fuel and air, interconnected to react and generate electricity.Micro-tubular <TECH>SOFC</TECH> fuel cell design geometries promise relatively fast start up times, typically on the order of minutes.WATT Fuel Cell has identified several key applications within the military including <WEA>UAVs</WEA>, UGV's, battery chargers and primary power to forward deployed forces.  "We have taken a simplified approach to system and stack design in order to streamline production and product support.  Reduction in system cost and standardization of componentry across various power platforms will enable us to provide a better product to the end user" Emley explained.Based on the content of this article, you might be interested in the following posts:Compact JP-8 Diesel-Powered Fuel-Cell Demonstrates Long Operation Durability Compact JP-8 Diesel-Powered Fuel-Cell Demonstrates LongHorizon Fuel Cell Tested on Elbit Systems' Skylark I-LE Mini UAV Horizon Fuel Cell Tested on Elbit Systems' Skylark I-LEBirdEye 650LE Mini-UAV Uses Fuel Cell to Fly Six HourStalker EX Mini-UAV Set for Eight Hour Endurance Missions Stalker EX Mini-UAV Set for Eight Hour Endurance Missions6th Annual Military Energy Alternatives ConferenceRelated Posts6th Annual Military Energy Alternatives ConferenceSkylark 1LE Adapts for the <WEA>U.S. MilitaryTailoring Unmanned Platforms</WEA> for New MissionsGlobe-i Zooming in to a "Window of Interest"Copyright   2013 <TECH>Defense Update</TECH> - Military Technology & Defense News.  All Rights Reserved.docno: 11631Benefits Of Nuclear <WEA>UAVs</WEA>By Bill SweetmanSource: Defense Technology InternationalMay 01 , 2012In March, <ORG>Sandia National Laboratories</ORG> <REL>released a summary of research it had conducted with</REL> <ORG>Northrop Grumman's unmanned systems division </ORG><REL>concerning an "ultra-persistent propulsion and power system" for</REL> <WEA>unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)</WEA>. The conclusion was that <WEA>UAVs</WEA> <REL>could be built with longer endurance and lower operating cost than with</REL> hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuel, creating "unmatched global capabilities to observe and preempt terrorist and <WEA>weapon of mass destruction</WEA> activities. "An earlier Sandia study concluded that such a UAV could be tested within a decade.  It will not be, because it is nuclear-powered, and politics make it impossible.  But the technical and operational case is powerful.Non-<TECH>solar</TECH>-powered <WEA>UAVs</WEA>, such as <WEA>Boeing's hydrogen-fueled Phantom Eye</WEA> and <WEA>Aurora Flight Sciences' Orion</WEA>, are expected to deliver multi-day endurance.  But they cannot carry large payloads or provide much electrical power, and are slow, so have to be forward-based.  They are also restricted to propeller propulsion, which makes stealth unattainable.The Sandia-Northrop activity is linked to studies of nuclear-powered <WEA>UAVs</WEA> in the <ORG>U.S. Air Force</ORG> that started in the mid-1990s, not long after the <WEA>Advanced Airborne Reconnaissance System</WEA>, a <WEA>conventionally powered long-endurance stealth drone</WEA> <REL>planned in the 1980s to track</REL> Soviet <WEA>mobile nuclear missiles</WEA>, was terminated.Sandia was heavily involved by 2001. A paper from the <ORG>Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments</ORG> noted that <ORG>Sandia's Special Projects Department</ORG> <REL>had proposed an</REL> "<WEA>extremely long-endurance vehicle (ELEV)</WEA>" or "air-breathing satellite. " The ELEV could fly at 70,000 ft. and stay on station for six months to a year with up to a 5,000-lb.  payload.  According to Sandia, building a modern <WEA>nuclear-turbojet engine</WEA> "would not be an <PROG>R&D project</PROG>," the CSBA report stated, "but rather an engineering development effort that could culminate in a flight test within a decade. "<WEA>Boeing's Phantom Works</WEA> <REL>was involved with the design of</REL> the <WEA>nuclear UAV</WEA>, a <WEA>high-subsonic, blended-wing body</WEA>.  Propulsion was based on concepts that emerged from the <PROG>Airborne Nuclear Power (ANP) program</PROG> of the 1950s, which <REL>was intended to lead to</REL> a strategic <WEA>missile carrier</WEA> that would remain on continuous airborne alert for a week or more.  It combined two <WEA>turbojet engines</WEA> with a reactor.  ANP looked at two designs: "direct cycle," in which the engine airflow cooled the reactor; and "indirect cycle," in which a liquid-metal coolant carried heat from the reactor to the engine.The 2000-era UAV <REL>enjoyed three advantages over</REL> ANP, which struggled to reach a performance level where the <WEA>aircraft</WEA> could fly.  Two stemmed from the fact that it was a UAV, which could take advantage of the propulsion system's endurance.  Planners envisioned features such as <WEA>magnetic engine bearings</WEA> to eliminate oil.  Importantly, more than half the weight of the <WEA>ANP propulsion system</WEA> was radiation shielding, which could be reduced in a system that would not run at full power near humans.  (In the Sandia studies, the engines burned jet fuel for takeoff and landing. ) A <DOC>USAF study</DOC> of a <WEA>Global Hawk</WEA> with a <WEA>nuclear engine</WEA> indicated it might need only 2,700 lb.  of shielding.The third advantage was improved reactor technology.  Air Force <REL>interest in</REL> ELEV <REL>coincided with the winding-down of</REL> the <PROG>Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion technology program</PROG>, in which Sandia was also involved.  SNTP <REL>started in 1987 as</REL> the <ORG>Strategic Defense Initiative Office</ORG>'s <PROG>Project Timberwind</PROG>, <REL>aimed at producing</REL> a <WEA>nuclear-thermal rocket</WEA> (developing thrust by superheating hydrogen) for a missile interceptor, but was canceled after the Cold War.  A Timberwind rocket engine <REL>would have incorporated</REL> a <WEA>particle bed reactor (PBR)</WEA>, with some designs weighing as little as 2,000 lb. , <REL>using</REL> carbon-carbon and ceramic-matrix composites.New reactor designs are safer.  They "would only hurt you if they fell on you," it has been suggested, because of specially fabricated and shielded fuel elements and robust "poison" systems to perform an emergency shutdown.  It is not known whether a PBR or a different modern reactor technology was the basis for the ELEV concept or the Sandia-Northrop Grumman study, which <REL>covered</REL> eight heat sources, three power conversion systems, two dual-cycle propulsion systems and an electrical generation system.  However, it was stated in 2001 that the propulsion system <REL>would power the <WEA>aircraft</WEA> while delivering several hundred kilowatts to</REL> <WEA>onboard radar</WEA>, <WEA>communications and electronic attack systems</WEA>.  <TECH>Conventional turbine engines</TECH> <REL>optimized for range and fuel consumption and sized for</REL> typical <WEA>UAVs</WEA> struggle to deliver 50+ kw at altitude.12Next Pagedocno: 117565 <PROG>Missile ThreatA Project</PROG> of the George C. Marshall and Claremont InstitutesRussia Might Still Use <WEA>Sea-Fired Nuclear Cruise MissilesChris</WEA> SchneidmillerPosted on January 15, 2013 by editorJan. 14, 2013 - WASHINGTON - There is cause to suspect that Russia might be deploying some number of <WEA>sea-launched cruise missiles</WEA> <REL>tipped with</REL> nuclear <WEA>warheads</WEA>, two decades after the United States put its version of the weapon into storage, issue experts say.The <ORG>Kremlin</ORG> might also be developing a next-generation version of that same missile type as part of its broader nuclear forces modernization, according to some observers.If true, the missiles could present a complication to future U.S.-Russian arms control negotiations - and a stealthy threat in the unlikely event of a nuclear conflict.'The sky is not falling.  I don't think that they're on the verge of deploying large numbers of new <WEA>nuclear-armed cruise missiles</WEA>,' said <REL>arms control specialist</REL> <P1>Jeffrey Lewis of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies</P1>.  'But it's something that's worth taking seriously and thinking about.  And, if one is committed to doing more in the arms control field, this is a question that is going to come up.'The United States definitively took its sole line of nuclear <WEA>sea-launched cruise missiles</WEA>, the <WEA>Tomahawk land-attack system</WEA> , off deployment in the early 1990s. Russia's management of an arsenal with various types of such weapons has been less clear, according to <DOC>Lewis.The U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</DOC> signed in July 1991 addressed only the class of weapons that <REL>generally have greater ranges and explosive yield than</REL> <WEA>tactical nuclear arms</WEA> intended for battlefield use.  However, the sides separately agreed to field no more than 880 nuclear-armed <WEA>sea-launched cruise missiles</WEA> and to issue yearly declarations on the deployment counts, Lewis said.Just a few months later, <P1>President George H.W.Bush</P1> announced unilateral pullbacks of <WEA>tactical nuclear arms</WEA> under which the <ORG>Navy</ORG> <REL>would during 'normal circumstances' not carry</REL> <WEA>nonstrategic nuclear missiles</WEA> on <WEA>surface vessels</WEA> or <WEA>attack submarines</WEA>.At the time, the United States held about 350 <WEA>Tomahawk nuclear cruise missiles</WEA> that could be launched from sea against land targets, according to <P1>Hans Kristensen</P1>, <REL>director</REL> of the <PROG>Nuclear Information Project</PROG> for the <ORG>Federation of American Scientists</ORG>.  The <ORG>Navy</ORG>, prior to the <ORG>White House</ORG> order, <REL>kept about 100 of the missiles on</REL> <WEA>attack submarines</WEA> and other <WEA>naval vessels</WEA> on a regular basis, he said.The Soviets - and later the Russians - held a number of <WEA>dual-capable cruise missiles</WEA> <REL>for deployment on</REL> submarines and <WEA>surface vessels</WEA>, but only the <WEA>SS-N-21</WEA> <REL>was intended as</REL> a <WEA>land-attack weapon</WEA>, according to Kristensen.  Production and deployment figures, though, are hard to come by.'This is Russian <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA>.  There's so much uncertainty,' he said.While then-<ORG>Kremlin</ORG> leaders Mikhail Gorbachev and <P1>Boris Yeltsin</P1> responded to Bush's move by pledging their own <WEA>tactical weapons</WEA> rollbacks, they did not 'unambiguously commit' to pulling nuclear-armed <WEA>sea-launched cruise missiles</WEA> from <WEA>attack submarines</WEA>, Lewis said.The governments in Moscow and Washington never released details of the <DOC>cruise-missile declarations</DOC>, which <REL>are no longer required following</REL> the <DOC>START treaty</DOC>'s expiration in 2009.'It seems likely that Russia declared zero, because if it hadn't declared zero it may very well have turned into a political issue,' <P1>James Acton</P1>, a <REL>senior associate</REL> for <DOC>nuclear policy</DOC> with the <ORG>Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</ORG>, said in an interview.Lewis concurred.  'I suspect the Soviets (and Russians) did, in fact, declare zero, if only because I would expect any other number to leak,' he wrote in an October post on the Arms Control Wonk blog.The <ORG>Obama administration</ORG> <REL>announced the decommissioning of</REL> the <WEA>sea-launched nuclear Tomahawks</WEA> in its <DOC>2010 Nuclear Posture Review</DOC>.  Russia, though, might be going in the other direction, <P1>Lewis said.Then-Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov</P1> stated in 2006 that <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA> <REL>were being carried by</REL> three 'multipurpose (i.e. attack)' submarines, rather than the <WEA>ballistic-missile underwater craft</WEA>, Lewis <REL>stated in</REL> his blog post.  <DOC>News reports</DOC> in recent years have suggested similar deployments.Kristensen, though, said that Ivanov's statement was indicative only of 'fumbled language' rather than demonstrating Russian nuclear cruise missiles were at sea.Russia has also faced scrutiny in the last couple years over efforts to sell a <WEA>short-range cruise missile system</WEA> that is designed to be hidden and fired from a shipping container.  The weapon is manufactured by the same firm that makes the <WEA>SS-N-21</WEA> cruise missile.'Although I suspect the intended audience for the <WEA>containerized cruise missiles</WEA> largely comprise tin-pot dictators some Russians apparently see stealth and mobility as a selling point,' Lewis told GSN .  'For Russia itself, submarines are probably the platform of choice.'The nation's ongoing <PROG>military modernization projects</PROG> <REL>encompass</REL> a new attack submarine and new cruise missiles, according to Lewis, who <REL>directs his organization's</REL> <PROG>East Asia Nonproliferation Program</PROG>.'They're working on a new cruise missile.  It's probably for air delivery, but one could imagine them converting them over' for sea deployment, he said.Among the rumors regarding Russia's cruise missiles is that a nuclear form of the <WEA>SS-N-30</WEA> is being prepared for the <WEA>Yasen-class atomic submarine Severodvinsk</WEA> , Kristensen said."In 1991, the United States and the then-Soviet Union, as a political commitment, <REL>voluntarily agreed to cease deploying</REL> any nuclear <WEA>sea-launched cruise missiles</WEA> on <WEA>surface ships</WEA> or <WEA>multipurpose submarines</WEA>.  The United States has no definitive information that the Russian Federation <REL>is not abiding by</REL> this political commitment,' <P1>Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Monica Matoush</P1> said in a prepared statement to GSN.The Russian Embassy in Washington said last week it had no information on the matter.Experts acknowledged that the information is circumstantial rather than definitive, but said Moscow might see cause for fielding nuclear <WEA>sea-launched cruise missiles</WEA> or building new ones.Russian leaders seemingly believe that cruise missiles and other naval <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA> have a role in countering stronger U.S. and <ORG>NATO</ORG> sea power, Kristensen stated by e-mail. '<WEA>Sea-launched cruise missiles</WEA> provide a relatively stealthy and accurate option to hold at risk a variety of regional targets,' Lewis said in an e-mailed follow-up to a telephone interview.Having the missiles ready for use could be a hedge against burgeoning deployment of U.S. <WEA>missile defense assets</WEA> in Europe, Acton added.  Submarines could fire a <WEA>sea-launched nuclear cruise missile</WEA> from a significant distance - the <WEA>SS-N-21</WEA> has a range of about 1,860 miles - and the weapon <REL>would have a greater chance of reaching its target than</REL> an <WEA>air-dropped bomb</WEA>, he said.'We're dealing with very low-probability, high-consequence scenarios,' Acton added.  'But if you're thinking of what <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA> are of more or less concern, then those features make Russian <WEA>sea-launched cruise missiles</WEA> of more concern.'He said that development of new <WEA>sea-based nuclear cruise missiles</WEA> would not necessarily be based on 'cold-blooded' Russian strategizing.  Rather, they could derive from jockeying for influence between various weapons design <WEA>bureaus.The missiles</WEA> could pose a threat to <ORG>Obama administration</ORG> hopes for a follow-up to the <DOC>New START nuclear arms control treaty</DOC> that <REL>would address tactical as well as</REL> <WEA>strategic nuclear arms</WEA> , Lewis said.  The United States and Russia began implementing New START, which <REL>caps deployed</REL> long-range <WEA>warheads</WEA> at 1,550 and <WEA>delivery vehicles</WEA> at 700, in early 2011.Russia deploys various types of nonstrategic <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA> , but could be particularly reluctant to allow inspection of vessels that might carry <WEA>sea-launched nuclear cruise missile</WEA>s as well as <WEA>conventional weapons</WEA>.'Once the Russians spend a bazillion dollars on a new cruise missile, the chance of an <DOC>arms control agreement</DOC> is much, much lower,' Lewis said.  'So I'm definitely engaging in the debate in anticipation of a threat rather than in response to [one].'An effort to resume SLCM data exchanges could help.  This might lead to other confidence-building measures and potentially some sort of agreement on the Russian weapons, Lewis has argued.The likelihood of Moscow and Washington actually agreeing to such measures in the existing strategic climate, though, is 'probably zero,' he said.This entry was posted in Publications and tagged Russia , <WEA>SS-N-21</WEA> , <WEA>SS-N-30</WEA> , Tomahawk , <ORG>NATO</ORG> , <WEA>Nuclear Weapons</WEA> , <DOC>START Treaty</DOC> by editor .

Nevertheless, there's no evidence that consumers are using Internet sites to diagnose themselves instead of consulting physicians, said <P1>Susannah Fox</P1>, <REL>associate director</REL> of the <PROG>Pew Internet Project</PROG>, <REL>in an interview with</REL> InformationWeek Healthcare .Overall, the study found, 81% of American adults had used the Internet, and 72% of Internet users had sought health information online in the previous 12 months.  Fifty-nine percent of online health information seekers tried to identify what kind of medical condition they had.Women outnumbered men within this group, and people who were young, white, high-income and highly educated were more likely than others to diagnose themselves or others on the Web, the survey found.Of the online diagnosers, 46% said that the condition they tried to diagnose needed the attention of a doctor, 38% said it could be taken care of at home, and 11% said it was either both or in between.Fifty-three percent of online diagnosers <REL>said they'd talked with</REL> a medical professional about what they'd found online.  Forty-one percent said that a clinician had confirmed their suspicions, and another 2% said that a clinician had partially confirmed them.  According to 18% of these people, a medical professional did not agree or offered a different opinion about the condition, and 1% said the clinician could not diagnose it.  The rest did not visit a medical professional.[ To see how patient engagement can help transform medical care, check out 5 Healthcare Tools To Boost Patient Involvement .  ]The likelihood of a consumer going online to diagnose a condition fell significantly with age: As a percentage of all U.S. adults, only 29% in the 50-64 age group and 13% in the 65+ age group did so.  However, among the 55% of Internet users who sought information about a specific disease or medical problem -- not necessarily for diagnostic reasons -- the age difference was much lower, with 43% of seniors going online for this purpose."Internet access drives information access," Fox said, noting that the baby boomers now moving into the ranks of seniors "<REL>are swelling the ranks of</REL> the Internet users.  If you look at the group of people 72 and older, Internet use drops precipitously. "For the first time, the Pew survey compared the percentage of insured people to the percentage of uninsured people who went online to look up health information.  They found a difference between the percentages of people trying to diagnose an illness online, versus the percentages looking up health information in general."There is no statistically significant difference between those who have health insurance and those who do not when it comes to using the Internet to figure out an illness," the report found.However, 75% of insured Internet users sought any kind of health information online, compared to 59% of uninsured Internet users.  Even more striking, 60% of the insured looked up information about medical conditions, vs. 35% of the uninsured.Fox speculated that insured people are more connected to the healthcare system than the uninsured and therefore more likely to look up health information online.  But she did not draw any conclusion from the fact that just as many uninsured as insured people try to diagnose diseases on the Web, yet fewer of the uninsured visit physicians.  Other factors besides insurance may be involved, she said.  For example, some people may be using websites to look up health problems that don't require a doctor's attention.The Pew survey also found that when people did consult a physician, only 1% did so online and 8% did so both online and offline.  In contrast, <ORG>Manhattan Research</ORG> recently reported that 39% of physicians said they e-mailed with patients.  Fox said it's possible that some doctors may go online with a few of their patients and that some practices may just have patients fill out forms online.  But the bottom line is that "a very small group of consumers said that when they had a health issue, they could contact their doctor online," she said.On another front, the Pew report <REL>noted that 20% of</REL> Internet users <REL>had consulted</REL> online reviews of particular drugs or medical treatments, doctors, hospitals or other providers.  And just 30% of Internet users <REL>had posted</REL> online reviews of healthcare services or providers.Fsox wasn't sure why so many fewer people use or post <DOC>healthcare reviews</DOC> than use or post them in other fields such as travel, hospitality and consumer products.  "But it's important for people to understand that there are just a few voices that are amplified [in reviews]. That's a challenge for consumers, doctors and hospitals.

"Illinois already supplies defined contribution plans to <REL>state</REL> university employees through its <PROG>TIAA-CREF program</PROG>.  That retirement system is the healthiest in the state since lawmakers are forced to match employee contributions in a timely manner even as they have ignored and delayed full contributions to the defined benefit systems.Illinois has the lowest credit rating of any state and is in danger of being reduced to junk bond status because its pension liabilities are 39 percent funded .

"If the legislature did not fully fund its contribution, the faculty would immediately know about it.  Whereas in a [defined-benefit] plan, they assume the money is going to there-it's obviously not. "<P1>Williams</P1>' proposal is gaining steam among some political insiders in Illinois but reform-minded Democrats, <REL>including</REL> <P1>Gov. Quinn</P1>, are cool to the idea.  The governor has proposed a number of smaller reforms to cut back on the system's $97 billion debt to no avail.  Democrats, who <REL>hold super majorities in</REL> both legislative branches, refused to vote on his lame duck push to create a super-committee to resolve the crisis.Conservative activists <REL>from</REL> the <ORG>Illinois Policy Institute</ORG>, a state think tank, opposed Quinn's plan because he seemed unwilling to push for major reforms."It's clear that <P1>Pat Quinn</P1> does not understand the full scope of the problem.  He's just flailing around," said <P1>Jonathan Ingram</P1>, <REL>IPI's director</REL> of health policy and <PROG>pension reform</PROG>."Defined-benefit plans are outdated, <REL>virtually unheard of</REL> in private sector and for good reason.  They assume that you can predict what the [stock] market's going to look like in 30 years, what the life expectancy is going to be; there are too many variables to account for. "Unions have fought against defined-contribution reforms, a major reason Quinn has not entertained the idea.  <P1>Anders Lindall</P1>, <REL>spokesman</REL> for the politically <P3>powerful American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees</P3>, said conservatives are trying to exploit the crisis by blaming employees rather than politicians for the funding shortfall."They won't be happy until no worker has a defined-benefit pension," he said.  "They want everyone to have private 401(k) accounts that have failed to provide an adequate retirement savings for the American middle class. "Defined benefit systems cut costs to taxpayers since pooled money can be managed at a cheaper cost than individual retirement accounts, according to Lindall.  The accounts also protect employees by putting their money in the hands of professional investors.The average 401(k) for households of people ages 45-54 lost about 7 percent of its value during the Great Recession, while households with younger people (ages 35-44) more prone to risky investments lost about 20 percent of their savings, according to <ORG>U.S. News and World Report</ORG> .Public pensions were not immune from the downturn.  The <PROG>Teacher's Retirement System</PROG> , the largest in the state, lost 5 percent of its value in FY 2008 followed by a 23 percent decline in 2009 before rebounding with a 13 percent gain in 2010.Ingram said the decline is indicative of the risks inherent in underfunding the system.  Illinois assumed its system would grow by 8.5 percent every year for decades.  Such optimistic assumptions allow lawmakers to pay less into the system but also force state money managers to invest in more volatile assets, such as stocks, rather than lower yielding but less risky fixed income assets."They're forced to reach for higher and riskier terms; there's no security," <P1>Williams</P1> said.The investment losses led Illinois to reduce its assumed rate of return to 7.75 percent in four of the state's five systems-teachers reduced their rate to 8 percent.  The lowered rates are still 22 percent higher than the average return of the best performing private sector pension systems at the start of the recession.Reformers should rely on bluntness to counteract union influence and political timidity, <P1>Williams</P1> said."We have to be honest with the workers and let them know that as things stand, there won't be any money left for them down the road," he said.  "There's only so much you can get from taxpayers. "This entry was posted in Big Labor and tagged Illinois , <P1>Pat Quinn</P1> , pension , <PROG>pension reform</PROG> .

Elsewhere, the <ORG>American administration</ORG> still has to win over nations that are reluctant to risk the economic punishment of being seen as allied with a <DOC>U.S. strategy</DOC> to constrain China's rise."If you stand still in Asia, you're going to fall behind the rise of China," said <P1>Robert S. Ross</P1>, a <REL>professor</REL> of <P2>Chinese foreign policy at Boston College</P2>.  "We're not going to stand still, but we can improve our rhetoric and disentangle from these territorial disputes. "Obama, who<REL>'s sometimes called</REL> the "first Pacific president" because of his childhood years in Indonesia and his upbringing in Hawaii, clearly has the political will to make Asia the focus of <DOC>U.S. policy</DOC>.  More than half of <WEA>American naval assets</WEA> are deployed in the region, the administration has signed <DOC>fresh defense agreements</DOC> with <ORG>Asian partners</ORG> and there's been a marked increase in high-profile U.S. state visits to promote trade and diplomacy.In November, Obama made a historic trip to the former pariah state of Myanmar, his fourth high-profile visit to Asia in as many years, and his <REL>secretaries of state and defense</REL>, <P1>Hillary Clinton</P1> and Leon Panetta, have been frequent visitors, as have numerous more junior diplomats and <P2>defense officials</P2>."There's no comparison," said <P1>Daniel Sneider</P1>, the <REL>associate director</REL> for research at the <ORG>Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center</ORG> <REL>at</REL> <ORG>Stanford University</ORG> in California, commenting on the <ORG>Obama administration</ORG>'s approach versus that of its predecessor.  "These guys have been there.  They've thought about it more.  They have a broad strategy. "Sneider, however, saw risk to that strategy in the pull of crises elsewhere.  "It has to be backed up by devoting real resources in the end," he said of an Asia focus.  "Any new engagement of <ORG>U.S. forces in the Middle East</ORG> will immediately undermine this policy. "Even in tightly knit Washington <ORG>policymaking circles</ORG>, there's confusion over how to pursue this new Asia focus, starting with what to call it.A first suggestion, "forward-deployed diplomacy," was jettisoned as too militaristic, especially when it comes to prickly superpower China.  Then came "the Asia pivot," which rankled <ORG>Middle Eastern and European allies</ORG>, who thought it suggested abandonment of their regions.  The <ORG>White House</ORG> now prefers "the rebalancing," while some policymakers are starting to use the blunter "return to Asia. "The semantics matter, analysts said, when one of the most sensitive parts of the plan includes dealing with Chinese suspicions that the maneuvering is intended to blunt China's economic and military rise.Any hope of a deeper, more complex U.S. focus on Asia, analysts who study the region say, hinges on how the second <ORG>Obama administration</ORG> tweaks the <DOC>long-standing policy</DOC> toward China that some dub "congagement," an attempt to blend containment of growing <ORG>Chinese military</ORG> power with engagement on trade and diplomatic issues.Justin <P1>Logan</P1>, the <REL>director</REL> of foreign policy studies <REL>at</REL> the <ORG>Cato Institute</ORG>, a <ORG>libertarian research center</ORG> in Washington, argued in a report this month, called "China, America and the Pivot to Asia," that few are fooled that <DOC>U.S. policy</DOC> isn't really about containment and that the United States should step back from involving itself in "every diplomatic flare-up" so that it retains greater distance from the squabbling parties."If the Chinese were getting up in our face saying, 'We're putting 60 percent of our naval assets in the Caribbean and developing <ORG>military alliances</ORG> with Cuba and Venezuela, and none of this has anything to do with the United States,' no one would believe that," <P1>Logan</P1> said.He suggests offloading some of the security responsibilities to allied nations such as Japan, South Korea and India, and encouraging talks among those nations without U.S. officials present, let alone in the lead.  <P1>Logan</P1> said it was healthy for there to be some doubts about exactly where U.S. forces would be committed in any regional flare-up. That would encourage nations to avoid such high-stakes disputes in the first place or to look inward for <DOC>defense strategies</DOC> and "help minimize free riding," as he put it.<P1>Logan</P1>'s report describes two polarized camps when it comes to how the U.S. should approach China.  The hawkish policy camp, nicknamed the "dragon slayers," demands a bigger U.S. military presence in Asia to restrict China's sea access and act as a barrier to any bullying of weaker nations.At the other end of the spectrum on <DOC>China policy</DOC> are the analysts <P1>Logan</P1> <REL>calls</REL> "panda huggers," who are betting that a focus on trade and diplomacy over military might will force China to democratize and become a more trusted U.S. partner.The administration's current plans call for deploying 2,000 Marines to Australia and four coastal combat shipsto Singapore - hardly terrifying prospects for the Chinese, the hawks complain.But critics of the notion that the pivot lacks military chops point out that there's already a huge U.S. military presence in the Asia Pacific, larger than during the most recent Republican administrations.  There are 40,000 American troops in Japan, more than 28,000 in South Korea and 4,500 in Guam, a self-governing U.S. territory.  There are six <WEA>aircraft</WEA> carrier strike groups and the <ORG>U.S. Pacific Fleet</ORG>, which <REL>conducts</REL> regular <PROG>joint military exercises</PROG> with Asian allies.When the <ORG>Obama administration</ORG> got serious about the pivot in 2010, <P1>Boston College's Ross</P1> said, "you couldn't have asked for a more robust strategic presence than we had at the time. "Obama has made that presence even greater, at the expense of irritating the Chinese without any appreciable strategic benefit.  That includes an increase in a U.S. military presence in South Korea that Obama ordered to reverse President George W. Bush's decision to reduce it by 40 percent - including a cut in <PROG>joint military exercises</PROG>, pulling troops out of the area between the demilitarized zone and Seoul, and announcing that in 2012 the U.S. would hand over wartime operational control to South Korean forces.In contrast, the <ORG>Obama administration</ORG> increased troop levels by 10 percent, <REL>signed</REL> four new defense agreements with South Korea, <REL>increased the size and scale of</REL> <PROG>joint exercises</PROG> and deferred the handover of operational control of forces until 2015.The moves, Ross said, came at a time when the presumed target of the posturing - North Korea - posed less of a threat than ever when it came to conventional warfare."If you're Chinese, you begin to ask yourself why this is happening, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that America's presence in South Korea is not directed at North Korea, but directed at China," Ross said.Obama's picks for secretaries of state and defense, <P1>Democrat John Kerry</P1> and <P1>Republican Chuck Hagel</P1>, have records of moderate stances toward China, which analysts say portends a policy of more engagement - not just with the Chinese, but also with other Asian powers such as Japan, India, Vietnam and South Korea.Kerry, especially, <REL>is familiar with Asia from his close involvement with</REL> the <ORG>Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs</ORG>."I expect him to pursue an intense strategy of engagement with China, with hedging," Sneider said.  "I expect Kerry to head down a path of trying to engage the new Chinese leadership as far as they're willing to go. "Analysts said Kerry should make it a priority to draw the U.S. back from involvement in territorial disputes over contested islands while ensuring that a more neutral stance isn't viewed as abandoning important allies.One fight is over the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands; the Chinese call them the Diaoyu Islands.  Taiwan also has staked a claim.  In December, a Chinese government airplane conducted a flyover of the disputed islands, prompting the Japanese to dispatch eight <WEA>F-15 jets</WEA> and an early-warning <WEA>aircraft</WEA> in response.The Chinese plane already was gone by then, and the situation cooled until Christmas Eve, when a Chinese coast guard Y-12 <WEA>aircraft</WEA> switched course to the Senkaku Islands.  Again, the Japanese launched several <WEA>fighter jets</WEA> and the Chinese plane left the area."People are watching this scrambling of jets, movements of <WEA>coast guard vessels</WEA> around these islands," Sneider said.  "On one hand, the U.S. is going to back the Japanese as our allies.  On the other hand, there's a message to both Japan and China to cool it. "The other big territorial fight is over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.  They're claimed by China and several other nations: Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Vietnam.After a long-standing hands-off approach marked by American platitudes about "freedom of navigation" and "peaceful resolution," Ross said, the <ORG>Obama administration</ORG> jumped into the fray in 2010 by gathering the common claim-holders for talks - but notably excluding China.docno: 123883Army Advances <DOC>Better Buying Power</DOC>(Source: <ORG>U.S Army</ORG>; issued January 28, 2013)WASHINGTON --- The <ORG>U.S. Army</ORG> <REL>has achieved significant cost savings and cost avoidance as result of its implementation of</REL> <DOC>Better Buying Power</DOC>, an initiative <REL>led by</REL> the <ORG>Office of the Secretary of Defense</ORG> <REL>aimed at improving the management of</REL> <PROG>acquisition programs</PROG>, incentivizing competition, eliminating redundancy and achieving the maximum amount of savings, senior service officials explained.In place since 2010, <DOC>Better Buying Power</DOC>, or <DOC>BBP</DOC>, is also geared toward incentivizing innovation and productivity while improving the capabilities of the acquisition workforce and strengthening the tradecraft of acquisition services, among other things."<DOC>Better Buying Power</DOC> has produced large savings.  We're continuously looking to optimize the use of the Army's money," said <P1>Tom Mullins</P1>, <REL><P2>deputy assistant secretary</P2></REL> of the Army for Plans, Programs and Resources.Some of the key tenets of the program include specific efforts to craft and implement policies which build <DOC>affordability and competitive procurement strategies</DOC> <REL>into the structure of</REL> <PROG>acquisition programs</PROG>, said <P1>Wimpy Pybus</P1>, <REL><P2>deputy assistant secretary</P2></REL> of the Army for Acquisition Policy and Logistics.An integral part of the achieved savings can be directly attributed to a portion of <DOC>BBP</DOC> <REL>referred to as</REL> the <PROG>Should-Cost/Will-Cost program</PROG>; this effort encourages program managers to explore enterprising and innovative program management methods and strategies designed to gain the maximum value from dollars invested, officials said.The "Will-Cost" is the initial baseline or expected cost of a given program or technological development, whereas the "Should-Cost" is, in essence, a lower cost achieved through successful implementation of efforts designed to improve developmental efficiency.The available data from the Army's Should Cost fiscal year 2012 Closeout <REL>highlight substantial successes with</REL> the <DOC>BBP</DOC> program since its inception.  For instance, the Army achieved millions of dollars in savings with the procurement of the Enhanced Performance Round, by lowering the production unit cost of the <WEA>M855A1/M856A1 lead-free 5.56mm ammunition</WEA>."For years we built <WEA>5.56mm ammo</WEA> with a lead core with brass wrapped around the outside.  It will have less impact on the environment than lead in the long run, lower cost material than lead and an improvement in performance of the round," Mullins explained.Finding and executing the proper contracting mechanism for each program is a considerable part of establishing greater efficiency through <DOC>BBP</DOC>, Mullins explained.  In fact, the Army's multi-year <PROG>helicopter procurement contracts</PROG> for the <WEA>CH-47 Chinook</WEA> and the <WEA>UH-60 Black Hawk</WEA> are expected to result in savings.  Multi-year contracts improve acquisition efficiency by allowing vendors to establish a stable supply and production schedule, all while securing a lower unit price, he added."<DOC>BBP</DOC> is taking a look at all of your tool kit of things you can do, and then assessing which ones are applicable to the program.  We've seen success in aviation with Black Hawk and Chinook.  The potential savings there are enormous," Mullins added.Other instances of <DOC>BBP</DOC> success include millions saved on programs such as <WEA>Excalibur 155m artillery rounds</WEA>, modifications to <PROG>Abrams tank and Stryker combat vehicle procurement contracts</PROG> <REL>designed to reduce costs and competitive acquisition strategies with</REL> the Counter Rocket Artillery and Mortar, or CRAM program.<DOC>BBP</DOC> also plays a role when it comes to the Army's Science and Technology development.  S&T influences a number of the tenants of <DOC>BBP</DOC> 2.0, specifically achieving affordable programs, controlling costs throughout the product lifecycle and promoting effective competition.Much of what the Army does within the S&T community can help achieve system affordability, said <P1>Mary Miller</P1>, acting <REL>deputy assistant Secretary</REL> of the Army for Research and Technology.  By designing technologies with reliability and manufacturability in mind, the Army can reduce the cost and time associated with redesign when these technologies transition from the S&T domain into formal programs of record, she said.  This results in lower developmental costs and potentially faster acquisition, she explained.By engaging program managers early in the technology development process and collaboratively defining technology, performance goals and acceptance testing, the Army can facilitate a more successful insertion of mature technology for emerging capabilities, Miller said."When developing new capabilities, one of the key things we need to do is make sure we reach technical maturity prior to integration.  This is an essential element of reducing risk and eliminating excess costs," Miller said.The Army, which has had great success thus far with the <DOC>BBP</DOC> program, is both cataloguing billions in cost savings since the program's inception while simultaneously preparing to implement the next iteration of the initiative, referred to as <DOC>Better Buying Power</DOC> 2.0."<DOC>Better Buying Power</DOC> is not a one-time event and you can be assured that neither is <DOC>BBP</DOC> 2.0, we must make it part of our culture," wrote <P1>Frank Kendall</P1>, <REL>under secretary</REL> of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, in a Nov. 6 memorandum for the Defense acquisition workforce."We have more reason than ever to believe that the efficiencies we seek can be realized based on the successes we've accomplished to date.  It is imperative that we stay the course in order to deliver even greater value to our taxpayers and essential capabilities to the warfighters," he wrote in the memo.<DOC>BBP</DOC> 2.0 seeks to build upon and advance the core tenets of the initial <DOC>BBP</DOC> effort and further instill a culture of cost-consciousness, increase procurement opportunities for small business and more efficiently execute affordable <PROG>acquisition programs</PROG>, officials said.In addition to its many other components, <DOC>BBP</DOC> 2.0 is also focused on sustainment and life-cycle management, meaning program managers are encouraged to consider the entire life or span of a technology or program's maturation such that they account for its entire life cycle.<DOC>BBP</DOC> 2.0 also aims to build upon the initial program's emphasis upon incentivizing industry by aligning profitability with contractor performance, officials said.  They added that in fact, this effort speaks to one of DOD's broad <DOC>BBP</DOC> goals, which is to emphasize that the program is designed to increase productivity and by no means reduce industry profits.-ends-docno: 123889Textron, <ORG>Rheinmetall</ORG> and Kongsberg <REL>Announce $100 M Contract on</REL> <PROG>Canadian Forces TAPV Program</PROG>(Source: Textron Inc.; issued Jan. 28, 2013)<ORG>Textron Systems Canada Inc.</ORG>, <ORG>Rheinmetall</ORG> Canada Inc., and <ORG>Kongsberg Protech Systems (KPS) Canada</ORG> today <REL>announced</REL> a $100 million <PROG>CAD contract</PROG> for work <REL>to be performed by</REL> <ORG>KPS Canada</ORG> on the <PROG>Canadian Forces Tactical Armoured Patrol Vehicle (TAPV) project</PROG>.

The NAO makes clear that the <ORG>MOD</ORG> has:substantially revised the way it compiles and manages the equipment plan and is now approaching the task on a more prudent basis;taken difficult decisions to address what was estimated to be a  74 billion gap between its forecast funding and costs;taken significant positive steps designed to deal with the accumulated affordability gap and lay the foundations for stability going forward.And concludes that if it continues along this path: the department will be able to demonstrate it has really turned a corner.The publication of the equipment plan <REL>follows</REL> the <DOC>Defence Secretary's announcement</DOC> last year that the Defence Budget has been balanced for the first time in more than a decade and that the <ORG>MOD</ORG> is taking a new approach to financial planning.Within the equipment and equipment support budget of around  160 billion over the next ten years, <P1>Philip Hammond</P1> has introduced for the first time a contingency of  4.8 billion to manage cost variation and protect existing projects.In addition, within the  160 billion,  8 billion is currently unallocated.

Frank Wolf (R-Va. ), chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds the <ORG>U.S. space agency</ORG>, that they support his panel's approach to<WEA> commercial crew vehicle</WEA> development."It seems unlikely that <ORG>NASA</ORG> will receive significant budgetary relief in the foreseeable future," the three retired astronauts wrote in a May 4 letter to Wolf.  "Consequently, it is mandatory to maximize return on the limited funds available to access low Earth orbit.  An early downselect would seem to be prudent in order to maximize the possibility of developing a <WEA>crew-carrying spacecraft</WEA> in time to be operationally useful. "House members are scheduled to debate the <ORG>Wolf panel</ORG>'s response to <ORG>NASA</ORG> 's fiscal 2013 budget request on Tuesday.  Report language accompanying the Wolf bill, which was approved by the <ORG>full House Appropriations Committee</ORG>, calls for "an immediate downselect to a single competitor or, at most, the execution of a <DOC>leader-follower paradigm</DOC> in which <ORG>NASA</ORG> makes one large award to a main commercial partner and a second small award to a backup partner "<ORG>NASA</ORG> prefers to maintain competition among companies vying for funds under its commercial crew development (CCDev) seed-money effort as long as possible, in the belief that it will ultimately cost less to develop a vehicle that way.  Under pressure from some of the CCDev competitors the agency also opted to continue the program under <DOC>Space Act Agreements</DOC>, rather than using the more restrictive <DOC>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)</DOC> approach.Wolf 's panel argued that a quick downselect would allow <ORG>NASA</ORG> to move back to the FAR procurement approach and avoid a complicated transition from funding more than one company under the Space Act to a FAR procurement.  The three Apollo commanders , who <REL>earlier urged <ORG>Congress</ORG> to resist</REL> <ORG>White House</ORG> plans to hand off human access to the private sector, agreed that a Space Act procurement "would be unlikely to provide the documentation that we normally depend upon to provide high confidence in reaching our technical goals. ""We all agree that our country has painted itself into a corner and does not now, nor will for many years, have a U.S. government craft suitable for carrying cargo or crew to the <ORG>International Space Station</ORG>," the astronauts wrote.  "The reputation of our country and the potential liability associated with carrying United States and international crews to and from the ISS dictates that we do everything possible to ensure that any commercial crew service meets standards equal to those that we would enforce would the craft be government owned and operated. "docno: 126402Remarks at the 7th <WEA>Biological and Toxin Weapons</WEA> Convention Review ConferenceRemarksHillary <P1>Rodham ClintonSecretary</P1> of StatePalais des NationsGeneva, SwitzerlandDecember 7, 2011ShareThank you, <P2>Mr. President</P2>.  And I would also like to express my appreciation to all of the delegates and to my colleague, <P1>Minister Rosenthal</P1>, for his comments.  I want to thank the <ORG>Implementation Support Unit</ORG> for all the efforts to advance the work here.I want to start by acknowledging that our countries have accomplished a great deal together under the <WEA>Biological and Toxin Weapons</WEA> Convention.  One hundred sixty-five states have now committed not to pursue these weapons, and I am delighted to welcome Burundi and Mozambique to the Convention, and I join in urging all states who have not yet done so to join.<P1>President Obama</P1> <REL>has made it a top goal of his Administration to halt the spread of</REL> weapons of mass destruction, because we view the risk of a <WEA>bioweapons</WEA> attack as both a serious national security challenge and a foreign policy priority.  In an age when people and diseases cross borders with growing ease, <WEA>bioweapons</WEA> are a transnational threat, and therefore we must protect against them with transnational action.The nature of the problem is evolving.  The advances in science and technology make it possible to both prevent and cure more diseases, but also easier for states and non-state actors to develop <WEA>biological weapons</WEA>.  A crude, but effective, <WEA>terrorist weapon</WEA> can be made by using a small sample of any number of widely available pathogens, inexpensive equipment, and college-level chemistry and biology.  Even as it becomes easier to develop these weapons, it remains extremely difficult - as you know - to detect them, because almost any biological research can serve dual purposes.  The same equipment and technical knowledge used for legitimate research to save lives can also be used to manufacture deadly diseases.So of course, we must continue our work to prevent states from acquiring <WEA>biological weapons</WEA>.  And one of the unsung successes of the Convention is that it has engrained a norm among states against <WEA>biological weapons</WEA>.  Even countries that have never joined the Convention no longer claim that acquiring such weapons is a legitimate goal.  But unfortunately, the ability of terrorists and other non-state actors to develop and use these weapons is growing.  And therefore, this must be a renewed focus of our efforts during the next 14 days, as well as the months and years ahead.Now, I know there are some in the international community who <REL>have their doubts about the odds of</REL> a mass biological attack or major outbreak.  They point out that we have not seen either so far, and conclude the risk must be low.  But that is not the conclusion of the United States, because there are warning signs, and they are too serious to ignore.Terrorist groups have made it known they would want to acquire and use these weapons.  And in the 1990s, the <ORG>apocalyptic cult</ORG>, <ORG>Aum Shinrikyo</ORG> unleashed two attacks in Tokyo by spraying a liquid containing anthrax spores into the air and unleashing sarin gas into the subway.  In 2001, we found evidence in Afghanistan that <ORG>al-Qaida</ORG> <REL>was seeking the ability to conduct</REL> <WEA>bioweapons</WEA> attacks.  And less than a year ago, <ORG>al-Qaida</ORG> in the Arabian Peninsula made a call to arms for - and I quote - "brothers with degrees in microbiology or chemistry to develop a <WEA>weapon of mass destruction</WEA>. "We all have an interest in ramping up our efforts to prevent outbreaks and attacks and then to be prepared to respond if they do occur.  The 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States killed five people and sickened 17. More than 10,000 were required to go on to antibiotics.  A mass outbreak could cripple an already fragile global economy by cutting off the movement of people, goods, and sparking food shortages.  And of course, a victim of an attack could just as easily travel from one country to another.So shoring up our domestic and international defenses will make it easier to detect and respond.  We need public health systems that can quickly diagnose outbreaks, whatever their source, and mobilize the right medical resources and personnel.  By making any one country more secure, we make the international community more secure at the same time.Two years ago, the <ORG>Obama Administration</ORG> <REL>released</REL> our national strategy for countering biological threats, which is a whole-of-government approach designed to protect the American people and improve our global capacity.  We support our partners' efforts to meet new international standards in disease preparedness, detection, and response.  We are helping make laboratories safer and more secure, engaging 44 countries in these efforts this year.  And since 2007, we've conducted more than a dozen workshops to help train public health and law enforcement officials.But there is still more to do, and I want to briefly mention three areas.  First, we need to bolster international confidence that all countries are living up to our obligations under the Convention.  It is not possible, in our opinion, to create a verification regime that will achieve this goal.  But we must take other steps.  To begin with, we should revise the Convention's annual reporting systems to ensure that each party is answering the right questions, such as what we are each all doing to guard against the misuse of biological materials.Countries should also take their own measures to demonstrate transparency.  Under our new <DOC>Bio-Transparency and Openness Initiative</DOC>, we will host an international forum on health and security to exchange views on biological threats and discuss the evolution of <PROG>U.S. bioresearch programs</PROG>.  We will underscore that commitment by inviting a few state parties to the Convention to tour a <WEA>U.S. biodefense facility</WEA> next year, as <P1>Ambassador van den IJssel</P1> and the <ORG>UN 1540 Committee</ORG> did this past summer.  And we will promote dialogue through exchanges among scientists from the United States and elsewhere.  In short, we are intending and our meeting our obligation to the full letter and spirit of the treaty, and we wish to work with other nations to do so as well.Second, we must strengthen each country's ability to detect and respond to outbreaks and improve international coordination.  As <P1>President Obama</P1> <REL>said earlier this year at</REL> the UN, "We must come together to prevent and detect and fight every kind of biological danger, whether it's a pandemic like H1N1, or a terrorist threat, or a terrible disease. " Five years ago, 194 countries came together at the <ORG>World Health Organization</ORG> and committed to build our core capacities by June 2012, and we should redouble our efforts to meet that goal.  We will support the <ORG>WHO</ORG> in this area, and I urge others to join us.Finally, we need thoughtful international dialogue about the ways to maximize the benefits of scientific research and minimize the risks.  For example, the emerging gene synthesis industry <REL>is making</REL> <WEA>genetic material</WEA> widely available.  This obviously has many benefits for research, but it could also potentially be used to assemble the components of a deadly organism.  So how do we balance the need for scientific freedom and innovation with the necessity of guarding against such risksThere is no easy answer, but it begins with open conversations among governments, the scientific community, and other stakeholders, in this forum and elsewhere.  We have recently had our U.S. President's Commission on Bioethics develop ethical principles that could be helpful in this dialogue, and we urge a discussion about them.  <P1>Ambassador Kennedy</P1> and the U.S. team look forward to working with all of you for a strong set of recommendations.And let me conclude by saying we know the biological threats we face today are new, but our commitment to face threats together is not.  More than 85 years ago, after the horrors of World War I, the international community took a stand against the use of <WEA>poison gases</WEA> and <WEA>bacteriological weapons</WEA>.  And nearly a half-century later, that shared commitment brought us together to adopt the <PROG>Biological Weapons Convention</PROG>.  So in that same spirit, let us move forward to address the challenges we face together in the 21 st century.Thank you very much.PRN: 2011/T57-19docno: 126678New waterjets could propel <WEA>LCS</WEA> to greater speeds14:53, Technology/EngineeringFull size imageThe <ORG>Navy</ORG>'s fifth Littoral Combat Ship (<WEA>LCS</WEA>), <WEA>Milwaukee</WEA>, will be the first to benefit from new high-power density waterjets aimed at staving off rudder and propeller damage experienced on high-speed ships.The product of an <ORG>Office of Naval Research (ONR)</ORG> Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) program, the waterjets arrived last month at the <ORG>Marinette Marine shipyard</ORG> in Wisconsin, where <WEA>Milwaukee</WEA> (<WEA>LCS</WEA> 5) is under construction."We believe these waterjets are the future," said <P1>Dr. Ki-Han Kim</P1>, <REL>program manager</REL> in <ORG>ONR's Ship Systems and Engineering Research Division</ORG>.  "Anything that we can do to keep ships ready to go will ultimately benefit our warfighters. "<P1>Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jonathan Greenert</P1><REL>'s</REL> 2013-2017 Navigation Plan calls for fielding improved ships to support counterterrorism and irregular warfare missions at sea and ashore.  The <WEA>LCS</WEA> will play a big role in the <ORG>Navy</ORG>'s plan as a modular, adaptable vessel for use against <WEA>diesel submarines</WEA>, <WEA>littoral mines</WEA> and attacks by small surface craft.Developed by <ORG>Rolls-Royce Naval Marine</ORG> in Walpole, Mass., <REL>in collaboration with</REL> ONR and <ORG>Naval Surface Warfare Center</ORG>, <ORG>Carderock Division</ORG>, the new <WEA>Axial-Flow Waterjet Mk-1</WEA> can move nearly half a million gallons of seawater per minute, providing more thrust per unit than current commercial waterjets.  Four of the new waterjets will propel the <WEA>LCS</WEA> to speeds greater than 40 knots.Researchers believe the smaller, more efficient waterjets will help the <WEA>LCS</WEA> avoid excessive maintenance costs associated with cavitationa  a phenomenon that occurs when changes in pressure create air bubbles on rotating machinery, such as marine propellers.  Repeated occurrences can cause whole chunks of metal to wear away, leading to frequent repairs and replacements.The waterjets' new design could increase their lifespan between repairs.The <PROG>FNC program</PROG> that <REL>oversaw development of this technology proved to be as adaptable as</REL> <WEA>LCS</WEA>.  The waterjets originally were slated to benefit another ship program that was discontinued.  Instead of cancelling the waterjets program, officials regrouped and shifted their focus to designing a product that would improve the performance of <WEA>LCS</WEA>.ONR's <PROG>FNC program</PROG> saves taxpayer money by streamlining processes to deliver cutting-edge products within five years.  The waterjets project began in 2007, and the delivery last month to the shipyard marked its successful completion.Next up for the waterjets will be full-scale sea trials on <WEA>Milwaukee</WEA> (<WEA>LCS</WEA> 5), expected to occur in the next 24 months.Eventually, the waterjets could end up on 10 <WEA>LCS</WEA> under contract to be built by <ORG>Lockheed</ORG> Martin.Provided by <ORG>Office of Naval Researchdocno</ORG>: 12686Space, <WEA>Nuclear Weapons</WEA>, and <PROG>Ballistic Missile Defense</PROG> - The New TriadMay 8, 2012 ::  The Heritage Foundation  ::In April, the <ORG>Independent Working Group (IWG)</ORG> on Missile Defense and the Space Relationship <REL>held an event on</REL> the new triad-space, <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA>, and <WEA>ballistic missile</WEA> defense-and its importance for the United States.  It explored the fundamental importance and the relationship among the different elements of defense.  The United States currently does not have a strategy that would integrate these elements in a synergistic manner.Robert Butterworth, <P2>president of Aries Analytics</P2>, pointed out that the intelligence community <REL>developed</REL> the military space systems the United States operates today.  That community, however, has fundamentally different interests than the military.  The United States needs to better articulate and determine what U.S. future military capabilities will be and what space systems would best address their requirements.  U.S. <DOC>nuclear policy</DOC> suffers from a similar lack of coherent vision, which makes the recent push for yet another round of nuclear reductions questionable.  The current guidance is full of contradictions: The U.S. has a plan for new <WEA>delivery vehicles</WEA>, but it <REL>must use</REL> old nuclear <WEA>warheads</WEA> and cannot test them.Keith Payne, <REL>president</REL> of the National Institute for Public Policy and <REL>former Deputy Assistant Secretary</REL> of Defense for Forces Policy, noted that according to the Nuclear Posture Review, <P1>President Obama</P1>'s top goal is nonproliferation.  The Administration assumes that missile defenses work against this goal by discouraging future reductions (note Russia's recent threats of a preemptive strike if the U.S. deploys its missile defenses to Europe). This leads to an irreconcilable tension between a drive to "nuclear zero"-a world without <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA>-and missile defense, plus the need to sustain nuclear forces.  In addition, with fewer <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA>, the Administration would be required to move toward counter-value targets (training missiles at an adversary's populations). This approach, rejected for more than five decades, has been considered immoral and illegal.  Resilience and adaptability, necessary to adapt to future threats and assure allies, are lost when the U.S. has a lower nuclear capability.Ambassador Henry Cooper, <REL>former director</REL> of the <ORG>Strategic Defense Initiative Organization</ORG>, emphasized that the United States will not move to the most effective and cost-efficient interceptors in space without strong presidential leadership.  Such leadership is lacking in the <ORG>Obama Administration</ORG>.  While the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is gone, limits on the <PROG>missile defense program</PROG> remain.  For example, so far the successive Administrations since the withdrawal from the treaty have not taken steps to make Aegis capable of countering short-range as well as intermediate-range <WEA>ballistic missile</WEA>s.  In addition, the Aegis program <REL>can be accelerated to give it the ability to</REL> counter <WEA>long-range missile</WEA>s, <REL>including</REL> intercontinental <WEA>ballistic missile</WEA>s.Rob Soofer, <REL>the <P2>Strategic Forces Policy Advisor</P2></REL> for <P1>Senator Jon Kyl</P1> (R-AZ), provided a congressional perspective by mentioning three issues that are a priority for the GOP leadership.  First, the Administration's commitment to the <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA> complex is fading, as the President's defense budget request this year is below what the Administration agreed to provide in concurrence with the <DOC>New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START)</DOC>. A loss of scientists without <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA> design experience is equally concerning.  Second, reductions below the New START level will not be possible unless the Administration provides funding for nuclear modernization.  Third, while the Administration emphasized regional missile defense, Republicans in <ORG>Congress</ORG> would like to see more resources invested in homeland defense.

(<ORG>Lockheed</ORG> Martin)Filed <ORG>UnderWorld NewsNorth AmericaVICTORIA</ORG>, BRITISH COLUMBIA - A leaked US document has raised new questions about Canada's involvement in the <WEA>F-35</WEA> program and given critics of the fighter jet as well as opposition members of <ORG>Parliament</ORG> new ammunition to accuse the Canadian government of misleading the public about the proposed acquisition.An Oct. 27 briefing by <P1>US Air Force Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan</P1>, <WEA>F-35</WEA> Program Executive Office director, outlined how Canada intends to initially purchase four <WEA>F-35</WEA>s. That flies in the face of continued Canadian government assurances that no decision had been made about whether the country would buy the <WEA>aircraft</WEA>.Defense News has seen a copy of the document.Canada's <ORG>Conservative Party government</ORG> <REL>originally committed in 2010 to purchasing</REL> 65 <WEA>F-35</WEA>s, but the acquisition soon became a major political albatross around the neck of Prime Minister Stephen Harper.Opposition <ORG>Parliament</ORG> members <REL>alleged his government misled Canadians about</REL> the <WEA>F-35</WEA>'s price and performance.In April 2012, <P1>Auditor General Michael Ferguson</P1> found that <P2>Department of National Defence officials</P2> <REL>withheld key information from</REL> <ORG>Parliament</ORG> about the jet, underesti-mated costs and didn't follow proper procurement rules.The government, under continuing fire about the increasing cost of the <WEA>F-35</WEA>s, announced in December 2012 it would put the procurement on a temporary hold and examine other <WEA>aircraft</WEA>.  That process is ongoing, <P2>government ministers</P2> said.But Bogdan's <REL>briefing to</REL> US Air Force <REL>Secretary</REL> Deborah Lee James undercuts those claims.  Bogdan <REL>pointed out that Canada wants to "swap"</REL> four <WEA>aircraft</WEA> <REL>destined for</REL> the US Air Force and receive those as early as 2015.The <WEA>aircraft</WEA> would be replaced at a later date by <P1>Canada.Bogdan</P1> noted in the 14-page briefing deck that the US Air Force agrees with the plan as long as the <WEA>F-35</WEA> initial operating capability date of 2016 remains on schedule and no other allies make similar requests.For the swap to happen, Canada needs to deliver a letter of intent to the <WEA>F-35</WEA> project engineering office this month, the briefing points out.  <ORG>Congress</ORG> would also have to be notified.Kyra Hawn, <REL>spokeswoman</REL> for the <WEA>F-35</WEA> Joint Program Office, said the "briefing was for official use only.  It was to inform future decisions regarding Canada's <WEA>F-35</WEA> acquisition.  We will not be commenting any further on the content of the slides.

"He did not explain why Bogdan <REL>was informing</REL> James about Canada's decision to proceed with the <WEA>F-35</WEA> if the Canadian government <REL>still had not made a decision on purchasing</REL> the <WEA>aircraft</WEA>.But analysts and opposition MPs <REL>are pointing to</REL> Bogdan's briefing as a smoking gun that proves the <ORG>Conservative Party government</ORG> <REL>has been misleading</REL> <ORG>Parliament</ORG> and the Canadian public."Getting into the production line this fiscal year is clearly an intention to go ahead and buy those planes," said <P1>Jack Harris</P1>, <REL>defense critic</REL> with the official opposition New <ORG>Democratic Party.He</ORG> noted that the Bogdan briefing proves the Canadian government is "going behind the backs of Canadians" and that it plans to move ahead with the acquisition despite continuing concerns about the <WEA>F-35</WEA> and its costs."[The public is] just being deceived by this government taking action without the kind of transparency that's required, without the proper debate, without notifying Canadians, without notifying <ORG>Parliament</ORG>," Harris added.Alan <P1>Williams</P1>, <REL>the <P2>former Canadian defense procurement chief</P2></REL>, said the information contained in Bogdan's briefing raises questions about the government's claims it is examining other <WEA>aircraft</WEA> <REL>besides the <WEA>F-35</WEA> to replace</REL> the <WEA>CF-18s</WEA>."The government claims about a fair and transparent process are called into question," <P1>Williams</P1> said.Some Canadian <REL><ORG>aerospace industry</ORG> representatives and political analysts</REL>, such as <P1>Michael Byers of the University of British Columbia</P1>, see the move as designed to quickly lock the country into an <WEA>F-35</WEA> purchase before any competition could be considered.Industry representatives said the move was clumsy, destined to fail and will only provide further ammunition for <WEA>F-35</WEA> critics.Canada is still an official partner in the <WEA>F-35</WEA> program and has not informed the <ORG>US government</ORG> or <ORG>Lockheed</ORG> Martin of any plans to change that.  Canada operates 78 CF-18 fighter <WEA>aircraft</WEA>.  It was originally planning to replace those with the conventional take-off and landing version of the <WEA>F-35</WEA>.In the meantime, the Canadian government has ordered a modernization program for the <WEA>CF-18s</WEA> to keep them flying until 2025.<P1>Johanna Quinney</P1>, <REL>spokeswoman</REL> for <P1>Defence Minister Rob Nicholson</P1>, said the modernization project is expected to start in 2016 and be completed in 2019.The program will include replacement of some flight controls, as well as structural and avionics upgrades.  <WEA>Core CF-18 avionics systems</WEA> will also need to be augmented to provide secure communi-cations between the CF-18 and allied units, Quinney said.

Beginning Sunday, November 16, the <ORG>Ernest N. Morial Convention Center </ORG><REL>became home to</REL> the fastest and most innovative computer network, delivering more than 1.3 trillion bits per second (terabits per second!) of network bandwidth to the Supercomputing Conference (SC14) from around the world."By building the fastest, most innovative operational network possible every year, <ORG>SCinet</ORG> gives the <P3>SC conference attendees</P3> a unique chance to showcase and <REL>discover the latest research in</REL> <TECH>HPC</TECH>," says <P1>Kate Petersen Mace</P1>, <REL>Director of External Partnership Management</REL> at Clemson University and SC14's <ORG>SCinet</ORG> Chair.  "<ORG>SCinet</ORG> enables data-intensive research and <REL>live use of</REL> high performing hardware to <REL>run</REL> multi-gigabit demonstrations, requiring a fast and robust infrastructure.  We start planning for <ORG>SCinet</ORG> well over a year in advance of the conference, with input from the <TECH>HPC</TECH> community.  This ensures the network will support the technical needs and challenge <P3>volunteers</P3> while operating the <WEA>latest vendor-provided equipment</WEA>.  I'm very excited to see how our attendees make use of our SC14 resources. "<ORG>SCinet</ORG> is built by a team of expert <P3>volunteers</P3> from around the world, taking one year to design the network, three weeks to set it up, four days to operate it, and twenty-four hours to tear it down.  Over 100 engineers from industry, academia and government institutions came together to build this network, <REL>using</REL> over $18 million in loaned equipment and over 80 miles of newly installed fiber optic cable lines in the convention center.This year, <ORG>SCinet</ORG> <REL>has connected</REL> multiple circuits, <REL>resulting in</REL> an unprecedented bandwidth of 1.3 terabits per second, in collaboration with leading national and international research networks and commodity providers.  <ORG>SCinet</ORG> <REL>partnered with</REL> the <ORG>Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (LONI) Network</ORG>, who <REL>received extra support from</REL> The <ORG>Louisiana Board of Regents</ORG>, to deliver the unprecedented bandwidth into New Orleans.In addition to the massive external capacity <ORG>SCinet</ORG> will bring to the convention center, the network is also supporting research initiatives through a half-day workshop, "Innovating the Network for Data-Intensive Science," which <REL>provides a unique opportunity for</REL> network <P3>researchers</P3> to <REL>showcase research on</REL> emerging topics such as <TECH>software-defined networking</TECH> and <TECH>application-based data transfers</TECH>.

"It is [in non-OECD countries] that we should expect to see - and should work hardest to accelerate - energy innovation," write the <P2>author</P2>s.  Among the report's <P2>author</P2>s are Gary Dirks, <REL>director</REL> of ASU's Global Institute of Sustainability, and <REL>consortium co-director</REL> Daniel Sarewitz.Through a series of detailed maps, <DOC>High-Energy Innovation</DOC> <REL>charts</REL> <TECH>energy innovation in shale gas</TECH>, <TECH>carbon capture and storage</TECH>, nuclear, and <TECH>solar</TECH> currently underway worldwide.

"Consistent with the Fleet's views on the most valued capabilities delivered by a small surface combatant, the modified <WEA>LCS</WEA> ship will be more lethal and survivable.  It will provide multi-mission anti-surface warfare (SUW) and anti-submarine warfare capabilities (ASW), as well as continuous and effective <TECH>air, surface and underwater self-defense</TECH>. Adding to current <WEA>LCS</WEA> Flight 0+ baseline configurations, which <REL>include</REL> the <WEA>57mm gun</WEA> and <WEA>SeaRAM missile system</WEA>, this ship will be equipped with <WEA>over-the-horizon surface-to-surface missiles</WEA>, <TECH>air defense upgrades</TECH> (<WEA>sensors</WEA> and weapons), an <WEA>advanced electronic warfare system</WEA>; advanced decoys; a <WEA>towed array system for submarine detection and torpedo defense</WEA>, two <WEA>25mm guns</WEA>, an <WEA>armed helicopter</WEA> capable of engaging with either <WEA>Hellfire missiles</WEA> or MK-54 <WEA>torpedoes</WEA>, and an unmanned Fire<WEA>Scout</WEA> helicopter for surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting.Modularity design features will also be retained to augment SUW and ASW capabilities as <REL>directed by</REL> the <P2>Fleet Commanders</P2>.  Available mission modules include <WEA>Longbow Surface to-Surface Missiles</WEA> (Hellfire), two <WEA>MK46 30mm guns</WEA>, and two <WEA>11M RHIBs</WEA> for Surface Warfare, or a <WEA>variable depth sonar</WEA> for submarine warfare which, when added to the ship's organic multi-function towed array and embarked helicopter, make this an extremely effective <WEA>anti-submarine warfare platform.In</WEA> addition to the improved <WEA>weapon systems</WEA> capabilities for this ship, which reduce its susceptibility to being hit by a <WEA>threat weapon</WEA>, the small surface combatant will also include improved passive measures - measures that will reduce the ship's signature against mine threats, and measures that will harden certain vital spaces and systems against potential damage caused by weapon impact - to further enhance its overall survivability.From an operational perspective, the sum of these improvements will increase the ship's capability and availability to participate in <ORG>SUW Surface Action Groups</ORG>, <ORG>ASW Search and Attack Units</ORG>; escort of <ORG>High Value Units</ORG>, and support of <ORG>Carrier Strike Group (CSG)</ORG> SUW and ASW operations.With increased lethality and survivability, the modified <WEA>LCS</WEA> will provide the flexibility to operate both independently and as a part of an aggregated force.  This decision allows the <ORG>Navy</ORG> to <REL>add organic multi-mission capabilities to</REL> the small surface combatant force while <REL>leveraging the benefits and affordability of</REL> the <WEA>LCS</WEA> program.  The modified <WEA>LCS</WEA> ships <REL>will complement the planned 32</REL> <WEA>LCS</WEA> ships, resulting in a 52 <WEA>ship Small Surface Combatant Fleet</WEA> <REL>in keeping with</REL> the <ORG>Navy</ORG>'s Force Structure Analysis.  The 32 <WEA>LCS</WEA> ships, with their full modular capability, will allow the <ORG>Navy</ORG> to deploy assets to meet the <ORG>Navy</ORG>'s mine warfare, SUW, and ASW demands.For more <ORG>Navy</ORG> news go to: <ORG>Navy</ORG> News Service .TAGS: <TECH>Cybersecurity</TECH> , Spectrum , Telecommunications , Wireless , WorkforceSANTA RITA, Guam (Dec. 11, 2014) The littoral combat ship USS Fort Worth (<WEA>LCS</WEA> 3) is moored at Apra Harbor on U.S. Naval Base Guam.

The automated process will be used to make canopies-the transparent shells around the <WEA>cockpits-for</WEA> more than 2,000 <WEA>aircraft</WEA>, saving as much as $125 million over the life of the <WEA>F-35</WEA> program.ONR ManTech <REL>led a team of</REL> military and industry scientists and engineers in automating the thermoforming process used to create <WEA>F-35</WEA> canopies, saving time and money and eliminating potential hazards for human work crews."This award confirms our commitment to developing the most efficient and cost-effective ways to manufacture some of the most critical hardware our Sailors and Marines use," said <P1>John Carney</P1>, <P2>director of ONR</P2><REL>'s</REL> <PROG>ManTech program.The automation project</PROG> began in 2011 and cost just $1.3 million.  Much of the work was carried out at the <ORG>Composites Manufacturing Technology Center</ORG> , one of seven centers of excellence under ONR<REL>'s</REL> ManTech program."The potential cost savings represent a huge return on a relatively small initial investment by ONR," said <P1>Neil Graf</P1>, <REL>Program Officer</REL> for ONR ManTech.The <WEA>F-35</WEA> canopy <REL>represents the cutting edge in</REL> <WEA>aircraft</WEA> design.  Its unique shape and specialized material the make the canopy manufacturing process more complex than that for other <WEA>aircraft</WEA>.Currently, skilled technicians load an acrylic shell into a forming tool and load the assembly into an oven heated to 200 degrees where the canopy forms over a span of up to six days.  During that time, workers regularly enter the oven to makes observations and manually adjust positioning clamps to control the forming process.The new method uses a <WEA>control system with cameras</WEA> to see inside the oven to calculate the rate at which the canopy's shape is forming.  The clamps automatically adjust to ensure the shape remains uniform throughout the process to meet the <WEA>F-35</WEA>'s stringent requirements.The new system gets the job done in just two or three days.  It also requires fewer tools and oven time and less clean-up afterwards.  Most importantly, workers no longer have to enter the hot ovens.The automated thermoforming process underscores the <P2>Chief of Naval Operations'  Navigation Plan</P2> that calls for the service to continue efforts to make investments to address near-term challenges and develop future capabilities even in the face of budget constraints.ONR ManTech <REL>partnered with experts from</REL> the <WEA>F-35</WEA> Program Office, <ORG>Naval Air Systems Command</ORG>, <ORG>GKN Aerospace Transparency Systems</ORG> and <ORG>Penn State's Applied Research Laboratory</ORG> to <REL>develop</REL> the automated system.<ORG>GKN Aerospace Transparency Systems</ORG>, <REL>in coordination with</REL> the <WEA>F-35</WEA> Program Office, plans to implement the new process in May 2015.<P1>Eric Beidel</P1> is a <REL>contractor</REL> in <ORG>ONR's Corporate Strategic Communications</ORG> department.About the Office of Naval ResearchThe Department of the <ORG>Navy</ORG><REL>'s</REL> <ORG>Office of Naval Research (ONR)</ORG> <REL>provides the science and technology necessary to maintain</REL> the <ORG>Navy</ORG> and <ORG>Marine Corps</ORG>' technological advantage.

" The most important being the <DOC>1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty</DOC>, which the U.S. accuses Russia of violating by flight testing a new cruise missile.--"Despite the dispute, it would be a huge mistake for the United States to withdraw from the <DOC>I.N.F. treaty</DOC>, as some congressmen have demanded.  That would remove all restraints on Russia and seriously weaken a system of treaties that has been remarkably effective over decades at curbing the spread of <WEA>destructive weapons</WEA>.  It would also be a mistake for either side to reintroduce the <WEA>banned weapons</WEA> onto their own territory or elsewhere.

CorkerUS-Russia Relationsdocno: 449895News | January 8, 2015Improved Saturn Positions Help Spacecraft Navigation, Planet Studies, Fundamental PhysicsScientists have used the <ORG>National Science Foundation</ORG><REL>'s</REL> <WEA>Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) radio-telescope system</WEA> and <ORG>NASA</ORG><REL>'s</REL> <WEA>Cassini spacecraft</WEA> to measure the position of Saturn and its family of moons to within about a mile -- at a range of nearly a billion miles.  This feat improves astronomers' knowledge of the dynamics of our Solar System and also benefits <TECH>interplanetary spacecraft navigation</TECH> and research on fundamental physics.The <P3>researchers</P3>, from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (<ORG>NRA</ORG>O) and <ORG>NASA</ORG><REL>'s</REL> <ORG>Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</ORG>, used the <WEA>continent-wide VLBA</WEA> to <REL>pinpoint the position of</REL> Cassini as it <REL>orbited Saturn over the past decade by receiving the signal from</REL> the spacecraft's <WEA>radio transmitter</WEA>.  Combined with information about Cassini's orbit from <ORG>NASA</ORG>'s <TECH>Deep Space Network</TECH>, the VLBA observations allowed the scientists to make the most accurate determinations yet of the position of the center of mass, called the barycenter, of Saturn and its numerous moons.The scientists presented the results of their work at the <ORG>American Astronomical Society</ORG>'s meeting in Seattle, Washington.The measurement, some 50-100 times more precise than those provided by <WEA>ground-based optical telescopes</WEA>, was possible because of the VLBA's great resolving power, or ability to discern fine detail.  With its 10 dish antennas spread from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands, the VLBA <REL>operates as</REL> a single <WEA>radio telescope</WEA> with a virtual size nearly equal to the Earth's diameter.The result is a greatly improved ephemeris -- a table of predicted positions -- for the Saturnian system."An accurate ephemeris is one of the basic tools of astronomy, and this work is a great step toward tying together our understanding of the orbits of the outer planets and those of the inner planets," said <P1>Dayton Jones</P1>, of JPL, in Pasadena, California.  "The orbits of the inner planets are well tied together, but those of the outer planets, including Saturn, have not been tied as well to each other or to those of the inner planets," Jones said.The improved positional information will directly benefit scientists' ability to precisely navigate interplanetary spacecraft.  In addition, it will help refine measurements of the masses of other Solar System objects.  Also, the positional precision will improve predictions of when Saturn or its rings will pass in front of background stars, events that provide a variety of research opportunities.Other benefits will come to studies of several aspects of fundamental physics.  The new positional information will help <P3>researchers</P3> improve their precision when timing the radio pulses from pulsars -- spinning superdense neutron stars.  Such timing will help answer unsolved questions about particle physics and the exact nature of the highly-compressed material inside a neutron star.  Ongoing projects that time the pulses from multiple pulsars spread across our Milky Way Galaxy in an attempt to detect the effects of passing gravitational waves also will benefit from the improved Saturn ephemeris, which also improves the overall Solar System ephemeris.VLBA <REL>measurements of the position of</REL> Cassini have even helped scientists who seek to make ever-more-stringent tests of <P1>Albert Einstein</P1><REL>'s</REL> <DOC>theory of General Relativity</DOC> by observing small changes in the apparent positions of strongly-emitting quasars as Saturn passes near them on the sky.The position the scientists determined is that of the barycenter -- the center of mass -- of Saturn and its moons.  When two bodies are in orbit, they both rotate about the barycenter.  For example, the barycenter of the Sun and Jupiter is just outside the surface of the Sun, and the barycenter of the Earth and our Moon is about 1700 kilometers beneath the Earth's surface.  The barycenter of Saturn and its largest moon, Titan, is about 30 kilometers from the center of Saturn.  The barycenter of Saturn and all its moons (some 62 at current count) is what follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun.In other studies, the VLBA <REL>has been used to measure the positions of</REL> <WEA>Mars-orbiting satellites</WEA>, and <WEA>Voyager</WEA> 1, the most distant man-made object, now some 12 billion miles (19 billion kilometers) from Earth on a journey that began with its launch in 1977.In 2016, <ORG>NASA</ORG><REL>'s</REL> <WEA>Juno spacecraft</WEA> will begin orbiting Jupiter.

Marshall and Claremont InstitutesHaney: Strategic Deterrence More Than a Nuclear TriadDoD NewsOriginally published athttp://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp story_id=85225Posted on January 16, 2015 by editorWASHINGTON (<ORG>NNS</ORG>) - The United States' strategic deterrent includes a triad of <WEA>nuclear delivery platforms</WEA>, but other critical elements range from intelligence and missile defense to space and cyber capabilities and a capable workforce, <ORG>Navy</ORG> <P1>Adm.  Cecil Haney</P1> said here today.The <P2>commander of U.S. Strategic Command</P2> spoke on strategic deterrence in the 21st century during a discussion moderated by <P1>Thom Shanker of the New York Times</P1> and hosted by the <ORG>Atlantic Council</ORG><REL>'s</REL> Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security.The strategic deterrent includes a robust and agile intelligence apparatus, a synthesis of dedicated space and ground <WEA>sensors</WEA> that <REL>provide critical early warning for</REL> <WEA>missile launchers</WEA> and <WEA>bomber</WEA> threats, national nuclear command and control and the necessary infrastructure to sustain <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA> without fully testing the <WEA>warheads</WEA>, the admiral said.Other parts of the deterrent are a credible missile defense system that defends against limited attacks from rogue nations, <TECH>cyberspace</TECH> and space capabilities, trained and ready people, a campaign plan that orients assigned capabilities and activities toward a common purpose, and synchronized treaties, policies and strategies, Haney added.A Whole-of-Government Approach"This is not just capability but a whole-of-government approach that requires our attention and the necessary resources," Haney said, adding that the <ORG>Nuclear Deterrent Enterprise Review Group</ORG> <REL>recently established by</REL> <REL>Defense Secretary</REL> Chuck Hagel provides important support for the nation's deterrent.Even in an era of significant resource constraints the nation must get 21st century deterrence right, Haney said, and must make clear to adversaries or potential adversaries that restraint is always the better course."It will require us to work together as a team, as partners - the government, the private sector and academia," he said, "to shape policy that will have a meaningful impact on our national security. "Haney <REL>recalled</REL> <P1>President Barack Obama</P1><REL>'s</REL><DOC> 2009 Prague speech</DOC>, in which Obama <REL>publicly stated his goal for a world free of</REL> <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA>, and said the new <DOC>START treaty</DOC> between the United States and Russia - formally called <DOC>Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms</DOC> - is an effort to work toward that goal.Deterrents Can Fail"The president's 2013 <WEA>Nuclear Weapons</WEA> Employment Strategy and strategic documents such as the <DOC>2010 Nuclear Posture Review</DOC> and the <DOC>2014 Quadrennial Defense Review</DOC> make it clear that as long as <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA> exist," Haney said, "the United States must maintain a strong and credible safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent and   be prepared for the possibility that deterrents can fail. "Of the multiple states around the globe who have <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA> or aspirations of acquiring them, the admiral mentioned Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.Russia has had more than a decade of investments and modernization across its strategic nuclear forces, he said, adding that the U.S. approach to dealing with Russia in this context today is not about continuing the Cold War."This is about emerging capability at a time of significant concerns about Russians' execution of their near and abroad strategy," Haney said, adding that Russia has significant cyber capability.A Time of Significant ConcernsRussia also has significant cyber capability and Russian leaders have publicly stated that they are developing counter-space capabilities and that <ORG>Russia's armed forces</ORG> have <WEA>anti-satellite weapon</WEA>s and conduct anti-satellite research.China also is modernizing its strategic forces, the admiral said, by enhancing silo-based intercontinental <WEA>ballistic missile</WEA>s, conducting the first fleet tests of a new <WEA>mobile missile</WEA> and making progress on a successor expected to be another <WEA>road-mobile ICBM </WEA><REL>capable of carrying</REL> multiple <WEA>warheads</WEA>.  China is also testing and integrating new <WEA>ballistic missile</WEA> submarines, providing that nation with its first sea-based strategic nuclear deterrent, Haney said."As I'm sure you're aware," he told the audience, "they're also developing multidimensional space capabilities supporting their access-denial campaign.  But with more than 60 nations <WEA>operating satellites</WEA> in space, it's extremely problematic to see China conducting missiles <REL>designed to destroy</REL> satellites. "North Korea continues to advance its nuclear ambitions, the admiral added, and Iran has made no secret of its desire to acquire <WEA>nuclear weapons</WEA>.21<P1>st Century DeterrentsHaney</P1> said, "21st century deterrents must be tailored to specific adversaries and threats, and in an integrated manner, so we can predict what deters and what prevents escalation. "Haney's top priority is to deter strategic attack and provide the nation with a safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent force, but he's also interested in international partnerships and promoting innovation for future capabilities.In the past year he's had meetings with defense ministers of South Korea, France and Australia, a <P2>former Japanese defense minister</P2>, the <P2>United Kingdom's vice defense chief</P2>, and five partners involved in space-sharing agreements.In October, he said, "we conducted a command-and-control exercise designed to train our <ORG>Defense Department</ORG> forces and access our joint operational readiness across all my mission areas with a specific focus on nuclear readiness. "Accessing Joint Operational ReadinessStratcom <REL>did this in conjunction with</REL> <ORG>U.S. Northern Command</ORG>, the <ORG>North American Aerospace Defense Command</ORG>, and Canadian partners in exercises that included Vigilant Shield, Positive Response and Determined Dragon.Another of Haney's high priorities is bolstering Stratcom's ability to anticipate change and confront uncertainty with agility and innovation."Last summer we cut the ribbon at U.S. Strategic Command<REL>'s</REL> <ORG>War Gaming Center</ORG> back there at <ORG>Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha</ORG>, to help enable and challenge our thinking with the ability to look at alternative scenarios, some plausible today and some unthinkable tomorrow," the admiral explained."We need to grow innovative leaders, identify new operational concepts and continue to develop <TECH>cutting-edge technology</TECH> so we can continue to evolve our ideas on how to deter our adversaries and potential adversaries and, of course, assure our allies. "Finding Problems, Plucking Them OutBut Haney said the nation would not have a credible strategic deterrent today if it were not for the men and women, military and civilian, "who conduct and contribute to our <DOC>strategic deterrent mission</DOC> day in and day out, across all areas.  From under the sea to geosynchronous orbit, they are making concrete contributions to our security 24/7, 365 days a year. "About the much-publicized problems over the past year with some members of the nuclear force, Haney said that when such problems are found, no matter where they are, "we pluck [them] out of our system   and get through some root-cause analysis to figure out what we should be doing associated with that particular problem. "He added, "When you look at 90 percent of our team, [they] come to work every day to do the right thing, passionate over the mission. "In any organization, the admiral said, "You have to continue to work on that other percentage of folks   and in this case I'm very happy that we found the problem, eradicated the problem from our system and went to work with this <ORG>Nuclear Enterprise Review</ORG> business to work on those problems. "Charged About the <P1>MissionHaney</P1> said he spent 2014 traveling and meeting with all of those involved in the <DOC>strategic deterrent mission</DOC>."I can say unequivocally that those folks are fired up and charged about the mission," he said.  "I think the rest of us need to support them in how we talk about it and associate it with the plans we have now. "The admiral added, "I am proud of working with those great Americans.

The Pentagon <REL>requested $88 billion in</REL> OCO funding.When asked where the extra OCO money came from, an <REL>aide</REL> to <P1>Sen. Daniel Inouye</P1>, <P1>D-Hawaii</P1>, <REL>chairman</REL> of the <ORG>Senate Appropriations Committee</ORG>, said the money had been transferred from one bill to the other to keep the base budget within the budget law's new spending caps.  The Pentagon's contingency funds are exempt from the federal discretionary spending caps.The panel looked to transfer anything it considered to be war-related, she said.This is the first of the 2013 defense bills that stays within the <DOC>Budget Control Act</DOC>'s spending caps, including the president's request.Funding for the Pentagon this year is nearly $29 billion less than was appropriated in 2012, primarily due to the drawdown of forces in Afghanistan, Inouye said.The $511 billion does not include military construction or nuclear <PROG>weapons program</PROG>s <REL>managed by</REL> the <ORG>Department of Energy</ORG>, both of which are included in separate appropriations bills.Within the top line, the <ORG>Senate panel </ORG><REL>made several adjustments to</REL> the Pentagon's spending request, including 475 reductions to programs requested in the budget.For example, the subcommittee cut $3.8 billion in "prior year funds that are excess to defense needs due to program terminations, schedule delays or contract savings," a subcommittee statement said.The subcommittee endorsed a plan from the <ORG>Senate Armed Services Committee</ORG> to <REL>pause all force structure changes proposed by</REL> the Air Force until an independent national commission can weigh in."The bill directs the use of existing funds for procurements of the C-27 Spartan [<WEA>aircraft</WEA>] and the RQ-4 <WEA>Global Hawk</WEA> Block 30," the subcommittee statement reads.  The Air Force <REL>had proposed canceling both programs in</REL> its 2013 budget request.The bill would also add $800 million to sustain current Air Force structure.After making its reductions, the subcommittee redirected that money to where it saw shortfalls.For example, the subcommittee recommends adding advance procurement dollars for an additional <WEA>Virginia-class submarine</WEA> and an <WEA>amphibious ship</WEA>.  It also reverses the <ORG>Navy</ORG>'s <REL>proposal to "prematurely retire"</REL> seven <WEA>cruisers</WEA> and two <WEA>amphibious ship</WEA>s by providing $2.4 billion to keep them operating through 2014.The bill adds $1 billion to the National Guard and Reserve equipment account.According to a subcommittee statement, funds were added for Army <WEA>helicopters</WEA>, including Sikorsky<REL>'s</REL> <WEA>UH-60 Black Hawk</WEA> and Boeing<REL>'s</REL> <WEA>CH-47 Chinook</WEA> and AH-64 <WEA>Apache</WEA>.The bill also increases funds to complete development of the <WEA>Army's Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance Surveillance System</WEA> and <REL>adds $142 million for</REL> high-definition video <WEA>sensors</WEA> <REL>requested by</REL> <ORG>U.S. Special Operations Command.The subcommittee</ORG> also recommends adding $194 million for additional <WEA>Patriot PAC-3 missiles</WEA>.  It would increase funds to continue Abrams tank production, which the Army has said it would like to temporarily stop so that it can fund higher priority items.The bill would fully fund the requested number of <ORG>Lockheed</ORG> Martin-built <WEA>F-35</WEA> Joint Strike Fighters, the Pentagon<REL>'s biggest and most expensive weapon program</REL>.The subcommittee recommends adding $500 million to the <ORG>Missile Defense Agency</ORG>, <REL>including $211 billion for</REL> Iron Dome, a <WEA>rocket-defense system</WEA> being developed jointly for Israel.For Afghanistan, the bill would provide $5 billion for the <PROG>Afghanistan Security Forces Fund</PROG>, $200 million for the <PROG>Commander's Emergency Response Program</PROG> and $350 million for the Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund.The full <ORG>Senate Appropriations Committee</ORG> plans to mark up the bill Aug. 2, when several lawmakers will offer their own amendments.While the four key committees have now spoken, final decisions have not been made.  The <ORG>House of Representatives</ORG> has passed its version of the defense <P2>author</P2>ization and appropriations bills but the Senate has not, with no plans to take up these measures until after the August congressional recess and the Democratic and Republican national conventions.docno: 454513<ORG>Pratt & Whitney</ORG> <REL>Statement on</REL><DOC> DOT&E Report</DOC>(Source: <ORG>Pratt & Whitney</ORG>; issued Jan 20, 2015)Similar to previous reports, the latest DOT&E <WEA>F-35</WEA> report points to the tremendous amount of positive progress made by the <WEA>F-35</WEA> program last year.  The <WEA>F135 engine</WEA> specifically has averaged 98 percent mission availability, achieved more than 26,000 ground test hours, more than 21,500 flight hours, and powered more than 750 vertical landings.The F135 proved its durability through very rigorous live fire testing, and the engine also performed exceptionally well during carrier <REL>trials from</REL> the <WEA>USS Nimitz</WEA> in November, powering the <WEA>F-35</WEA>C without a single instance of unscheduled engine maintenance.To date, we have delivered 183 production engines to our customers.This <DOC>DOT&E report</DOC> lists propulsion issues that are well known to the <WEA>F-35</WEA> Joint Program Office and the Services.  These issues have been well documented and we are aligned with our customers on solutions.We have validated and approved an upgrade to the fleet to address the Eglin event, eliminated the flight restrictions on the <WEA>SDD fleet</WEA>, and begun implementing changes for the remainder of the fleet.The <WEA>F-35</WEA> program is 60 percent through flight test development.  We expect to learn things in development testing, and we will apply lessons learned to field the most technologically advanced and reliable engine for the warfighter. 2014 was a year of great momentum for the <WEA>F-35</WEA> program on all fronts.We remain extremely confident we'll be able to support our customers' future major program milestones, including U.S. <ORG>Marine Corps</ORG> Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in 2015 and <ORG>U.S. Air Force</ORG> IOC in 2016.( EDITOR'S NOTE: Contrasting with Pratt's highly (excessively ) optimistic statement above, here is what the <DOC>latest (FY2014) OT&E report</DOC> actually says about the <WEA>F135 engine</WEA> (emphasis in bold typeface is ours):-- Nowhere does the report state that "The <WEA>F135 engine</WEA> specifically has averaged 98 percent mission availability," as claimed above by Pratt, nor does it mention "750 vertical landings. "-- What the report actually says is that " <WEA>Aircraft</WEA> availability was flat over most of the past year, maintaining an average for the fleet of 37 percent for the 12-month rolling period. " This is exactly the same as reported a year ago, in the 2013 report.  In other words, there is no improvement whatsoever in availability .-- "Inspections of the engines on all variants led to discoveries on nine production and test <WEA>aircraft</WEA> requiring engine replacement. " (page 45) In other words, one in ten <WEA>F135 engine</WEA>s has the same defect, and must be replaced.-- "Availability of the operational test <WEA>aircraft</WEA> <REL>will continue to be [adversely] affected in</REL> <WEA>CY15</WEA> and <WEA>CY16</WEA> by the depot time required for [engine] modifications. " (Page 40)"It is [still] not clear what occurred differently than expected in the <WEA>air vehicle</WEA> and/or engine that caused the excessive rubbing" which led to the June 23 catastrophic failure.  (page 45)-- "Additional details and analyses of the uncontained F135 fan blade release and subsequent fuel fire in an <WEA>F-35</WEA>A at <ORG>Eglin AFB</ORG> in June are needed to support and update the existing engine vulnerability assessment. " (page 42)-- "The uncontained F135 fan blade release and subsequent fuel fire in an <WEA>F-35</WEA>A at <ORG>Eglin AFB</ORG> in June provides an additional data point that needs to be reviewed and analyzed to support the <WEA>F-35</WEA> vulnerability assessment. " (page 57)-- Operating restrictions stemming from the engine failure remain in force, and "<REL>must be relieved for</REL> the test <WEA>aircraft</WEA> such that all blocked test points are made available.

Source: IHS/Daniel WasserblyKey PointsThe size and deployability of <WEA>JLTV</WEA>s <REL>is questioned by</REL> the Pentagon<REL>'s</REL> director of operational test and evaluation<P1>Testers</P1> found that <ORG>USMC</ORG> amphibious assaults would suffer from the added time needed to deploy <WEA>JLTV</WEA>sPentagon testers have found that Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (<WEA>JLTV</WEA>) prototypes are slow to deploy from ship to shore and, therefore, leaves US <ORG>Marine Corps</ORG> (<ORG>USMC</ORG>) units "vulnerable to threats".The <P2>Director of Operational Test and Evaluation</P2> annual report on the previous year's testing, released on 20 January, found that during developmental test/operational test (DT/OT) events, <ORG>USMC</ORG> <REL>units with</REL> <WEA>JLTV</WEA>s were able to execute amphibious assault missions, but were hampered by the new trucks' lack of deployability."The <WEA>JLTV</WEA>s have large visual signature and their slow manoeuvre time from ship to shore prevents a Marine Expeditionary Unit from executing assault missions with tactical surprise, increases the time to close combat power ashore, and renders the unit vulnerable to threats," the report said."Testing showed that <WEA>JLTV</WEA>s are slower to load, prepare for fording, and transition to manoeuvre ashore than <WEA>HMMWV [Humvees]</WEA>" that they are meant to replace, the document said.  <P1>Testers</P1> explained that the issues were caused by the <WEA>JLTV</WEA>'s overall larger size (vehicle suspensions are dropped so they can better fit in <WEA>amphibious ship</WEA>s) and "delays that occur while awaiting suspension mode, and other vehicle adjustments" such as adjusting tyre pressure.A <P3>spokesman for the Army Program Executive Office for Combat Support & Combat Service Support</P3> declined to comment on whether the office has developed a plan to address deficiencies outlined in the report.The DT/OT events occurred in April 2014, with US Army and <ORG>USMC</ORG> units <REL>using</REL> <WEA>CH-47F Chinook</WEA> and CH-53E Super Stallion <WEA>helicopters</WEA> for an air assault mission, and a <ORG>USMC</ORG> unit <REL>using</REL> <WEA>Landing Craft Utility vessels</WEA> for amphibious assault missions.<P1>Testers</P1> found that units with <WEA>JLTV</WEA>s - and <WEA>organic armour assets</WEA> - can execute air assault missions.However, "the three <WEA>JLTV</WEA> contractor vehicles were more difficult to rig, de-rig, and load weapons due to vehicle height and lack of vehicle handholds and footholds than HMMWV," the report said.  "They had limited space to carry crew, <WEA>mission essential equipment</WEA>, weapons, and their sustainment load because of the small interior compartment. "The DT/OT revealed that <WEA>JLTV</WEA>s have better manoeuvrability in soft soil and better fording capability than legacy Humvees, but crew visibility is lower "because of smaller windows, placement of <WEA>mission equipment</WEA>, and positioning of window panels".ANALYSISIt is no surprise that <WEA>JLTV</WEA>s <REL>have a larger 'visual signature' than the smaller</REL> Humvee; they are indeed bigger vehicles and ride higher from the ground to protect against underbelly mine blasts.However, it is notable that this larger size affects the speed at which marines can prepare the vehicles for battle (due to time spent raising the suspension, inflating tyres, and climbing to load equipment).The <ORG>USMC</ORG> <REL>has at times appeared a reluctant customer for</REL> the <WEA>JLTV</WEA> as the corps is trying to get lighter and more mobile after years spent fighting land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with heavier platforms.  <P3>Marine planners</P3> had accepted the size and weight trade-off to gain more protection, but it will be interesting to see if the deployability issue can be resolved or be justified.Either way, the question must be answered soon because the <ORG>USMC</ORG><REL>'s</REL> planned 5,500 <WEA>JLTV</WEA>s are to be bought early in the production run and an initial operating capability is scheduled for fiscal year 2018.Related article: AUSA Winter 2014: Army to seek new medium truck family in mid-2020s(585 words)Related IHS ProductsIHS Jane's Defence: PlatformsIHS Jane's Defence: Air & SpaceIHS Jane's Defence: LandIHS Jane's Defence: SeaIHS Jane's Defence: Land PlatformsIHS Jane's Land Warfare Platforms: Armoured Fighting VehiclesIHS Jane's Land Warfare Platforms: Artillery & Air DefenceIHS Jane's Land Warfare Platforms: Logistics, Support & UnmannedIHS Jane's Land Warfare Platforms: System UpgradesIHS Jane's Defence WeeklyBy posting a comment you confirm that you have read and accept our Posting Rules and our Terms of Use of this site.
