docno: 1111Transition services now mandatory for soldiersBy Jim Tice - Staff writerPosted : Tuesday Apr 3, 2012 16:44:56 EDTFORT KNOX, Ky. - Soldiers now must participate in transition services before they leave active duty.An execution order requiring them to make use of the services is in force throughout the Army.The order applies to all soldiers who are leaving active duty, whether they are Regular Army members who are separating or retiring or reservists demobilizing after six months or more on active duty.The order, which implements a directive issued last year by Army Secretary John McHugh, further requires that transition processing begin at least 12 months before a soldier leaves active duty and that the soldier's commander oversee the process.The new procedures will be bolstered later this year when the Veterans Opportunity to Work Act is implemented Nov. 20 for all the military services."From the Army standpoint, we are planning for that mandate, and getting additional resources to support implementation across the active and reserve components," said Walter M. Herd, director of the Army Career and Alumni Program.This will result in about a 300 percent increase in the number of soldiers participating in transition services, Herd said.ACAP, a longtime Army program, assists departing soldiers, family members and Army career civilians in preparing for civilian life through myriad counseling, education, job-preparation and job-search services at 54 centers in the U.S. and overseas.The centers are staffed by counselors who have graduate degrees in counseling and who can link up departing soldiers with training and services offered by the Army and other government agencies, such as the Labor and Veterans Affairs departments.ACAP also operates a new 24-hour, seven-day-a-week call center here, and an interactive website for the virtual delivery of information and services, to include counseling.Regular Army soldiers leaving active duty should begin their transition 24 months in advance of retirement and 18 to 12 months in advance of separation, Herd said."Ideally, the soldier should go to an ACAP center, receive a pre-separation briefing and begin to map out his or her transition plan," he said.  "This will be an individual plan to lay out how the person will transition from being a soldier to being a civilian.
